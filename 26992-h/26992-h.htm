<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CASTLES IN SPAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>The unclouded sun of a burning August day had
driven bird and beast to shelter wherever a bit of
shade could be found. The Kansas prairie afforded
little refuge from sun or wind. The long stretches
of low rolling hills were mostly covered with short grass,
now dry from a protracted season of drought. Occasionally
a group of stunted cottonwood trees surrounded
an equally stunted looking hut, or dugout, but the blazing
sunshine had browned all to a monotonous tone in keeping
with the monotonous life it represented. The only
corn to be seen was of the variety called sod-corn, which,
unwashed by rain for a full month now, had failed to
mature, such stalks as had tasselled at all being as barren as
the rest because the tender silks had dried too rapidly and
could furnish no fertilizing moisture to the pollen which
sifted down from the scanty bloom above.</p>
<p>The sun&#8217;s rays beat down upon the head of a fourteen-year-old
girl who rode slowly around a herd of cattle, the
members of which lay in the unavailing shade of the
rosin weeds or browsed drowsily on the short grass. The
day had been long and hard. The child knew that it was
not later than two o&#8217;clock, having counted the hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
eagerly since early morning, and having eaten her bit of
cornbread and bacon full two hours before. She stopped
her horse for the fortieth time, however, to get the angle
of her shadow on the ground and to confirm her calculations.
The sigh she gave as she again started on her round
was not of relief, but of resignation. It was necessary to
keep on the move or she was likely to fall asleep in her
saddle, and then the cattle would escape to the nearby
fields, and there would be a neighbourhood altercation
over the matter, whether the fields held crops of value or
not, farmers being jealous of their territorial rights, and
ready to resent intrusion upon them.</p>
<p>Another horseback rider was moving across the prairie
toward her, and the girl smiled when she saw him and
stopped to watch his calico pony lope unevenly across the
grass-covered slope. The pony was prone to drop into a
rough trot at short intervals, and at such times was urged
to renewed efforts by a dig of its rider&#8217;s heels in the under
regions of its stunted body. In order to get his heels in
contact with his mount, the lanky boy was obliged to
elevate his knees slightly, and when it was over his feet
dropped languidly and his heavy plow-shoes dangled
loosely, with several inches of bare ankle in evidence before
the faded overalls concealed further stretches of the
hairy legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdie, Lizzie!&#8221; he said with a pleasant smile as he
drew his pony up beside her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to tell
you. We&#8217;ve sold out, an&#8217; goin&#8217; right off. Th&#8217; other folks
moved in last night. They was goin&#8217; through with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
wagon an&#8217; stopped to eat. They found out that pap
wanted to sell an&#8217; go back to Minnesoty, an&#8217; took th&#8217; land
quick. I&#8217;ve come to say good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had been so exciting that he had tumbled his news all
out at once, although he was a quiet boy and slow of speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Luther! Are you really going away?&#8221; The girl
exclaimed in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass,&#8221; the boy replied, falling back unconsciously into
Swedish pronunciation. He had begun his announcement
with pleased animation, but now that it was out, and she
was sorry, the going did not seem so pleasing. &#8220;I wisht
I wasn&#8217;t!&#8221; he added with quick dejection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d be glad. I&#8217;d be glad, if I was
going too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked surprised and asked with some curiosity,
&#8220;What do you want to go for? I thought you liked
Kansas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your hand on your horse&#8217;s neck,&#8221; she commanded,
leaning forward and setting the example.</p>
<p>The boy did as she told him, but drew his hand back
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t their hair get hot in
this sun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m just as hot as that all over,&#8221; she replied
emphatically, &#8220;and I want to go to a country where a
body can get under a tree once in a while. I can&#8217;t go in
till five o&#8217;clock, and I forgot my jug, and I&#8217;m so thirsty
I feel as if I&#8217;d crack like this ground,&#8221; she said, pointing
to the earth between them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jimminy! I&#8217;ll ride back and fetch you a drink,&#8221; he
said, poking his heels into his pony&#8217;s ribs so suddenly that
the little beast kicked spitefully.</p>
<p>The girl called after him to &#8220;never mind,&#8221; but he was
off on his errand. It was a good mile to her home, but
the boy knew what it meant to forget the water-jug on a
day like this.</p>
<p>When he returned half an hour later the sunshine had
changed character and there was a peculiar dimming of
its brilliancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it going to rain?&#8221; the girl asked as she lowered the
jug to her knee. She wiped her lips on the skirt of the
faded sunbonnet she wore and looked up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rain!&#8221; Luther Hansen swept the horizon with the air
of one who knew the signs, backing his horse about to see
on all sides as he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; don&#8217;t seem t&#8217; be any clouds,&#8221; he said in surprise.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it queer! Looks&#8217;s if it might be some kind of
eclipse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you remember&mdash;no, of course
you don&#8217;t&mdash;but, th&#8217; was an eclipse of th&#8217; sun&mdash;total, I
believe they called it&mdash;when I was only about seven
year old. All th&#8217; chickens went to roost, it got so dark,
an&#8217; when th&#8217; cover come off they crowed&#8217;s if &#8217;twas mornin&#8217;.
We had a blue hen an&#8217; she crowed too. Pap killed &#8217;er.
He said it was bad luck t&#8217; have a hen crowin&#8217; about th&#8217;
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You all don&#8217;t believe in luck, do you?&#8221; the child asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, but pap does,&#8221; the boy answered apologetically.
&#8220;I cried about th&#8217; blue hen; she was just like a dog;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
she&#8217;d let you ketch &#8217;er, an&#8217; she&#8217;d sing, &#8216;co-ook, co-ook,
co-ook,&#8217; to &#8217;erself, right in your arms, an&#8217; wasn&#8217;t afraid.
She wouldn&#8217;t never set though. I guess that&#8217;s why pap
was so ready with his axe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Happening to look up again, the girl gave an exclamation
of surprise. &#8220;Is it snow?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat with their faces turned skyward, studying the
upper air intently. The sun was completely obscured
now and the rapidly moving mass, not unlike snow indeed,
was being driven straight toward the north. Whatever
it was, it was driving fiercely ahead, as if impelled by a
strong wind, though there was not a breath of air stirring
below. Soon small objects began to detach themselves
from the mass, so that the eye could distinguish separate
particles, which looked not unlike scraps of silver driven
with terrific force from the tail end of some gigantic machine.
One of these scraps struck the girl on the cheek
and she put her hand up quickly to feel the spot. While
examining the place she received a similar blow on the
forehead and another on the back of her hand. Drawing
her bonnet down tight over her face for protection, she
shaded her eyes and again looked up. The whole moving
cloud had lowered to a distinguishable distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they&#8217;re all grasshoppers!&#8221; she exclaimed; and
indeed so true was the observation and so rapidly were
the grasshoppers settling that the boy and girl were obliged
to turn their backs and shield their faces from the storm.</p>
<p>The cattle also, annoyed by the myriads of insects
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
settling upon them, began to move about restlessly and
presently to mill slowly around, threshing with their heads
from side to side while they whipped their flanks with their
tails.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know they came like this!&#8221; the girl said, as
Luther&#8217;s pony sidled over toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you say?&#8221; the boy demanded, leaning forward
to catch her reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I didn&#8217;t know they came like this,&#8221; the girl
shouted, raising her voice to make herself heard above
the rasping noise of many wings. &#8220;Father read out of
the <i>Prairie Farmer</i> last week that they was hatching out
in the south.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two drifted apart and circled about the herd again.
The cattle were growing more restless and began to move
determinedly away from the oncoming swarm. To keep
them in the centre of the section, and away from the cornfields,
the girl whipped her horse into a gallop.</p>
<p>Without paying the slightest attention to either her
voice or her whip, half blinded in fact by the cutting
wings of the grasshoppers, the irritated cattle began to
move faster and, before either boy or girl knew what was
happening, were in full trot toward the north. Seeing
that the matter was becoming serious, Luther lent all the
aid of which he was capable and circled about the herd,
shouting with all his strength, but the cattle, contending
against countless numbers of smaller things and unable
to look steadily in any direction because of the little wings
which cut like the blades of many saws, stumbled blindly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
against his horse if he got in their way, and, shifting around
him, went on.</p>
<p>The girl was beside herself with trouble and anxiety.
Lashing her horse one minute, and the nearest cow the
next, she raged up and down in front of the herd, bending
all her energies toward deflecting her charges from their
course, but the struggle was useless.</p>
<p>Seeing that they could do nothing, Luther caught her
horse by the bit as she passed him and shouted explanations
in her ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em go, Lizzie! You can&#8217;t stop &#8217;em! I&#8217;ll have
t&#8217; come with you! We&#8217;ll just follow &#8217;em up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re going to get into that field right off if we
don&#8217;t get them turned!&#8221; the girl cried in distress, pulling
down her long scoop-like bonnet and holding it together
to keep the grasshoppers out of her face while they talked.</p>
<p>The cattle now broke into a run. There was nothing
to do but follow, as Luther had advised. But the exasperated
beasts were not looking for fodder and paid no
attention to the corn. They were not out on a picnicking
expedition; they were escaping from this tormenting
swarm of insects which settled on itching back and horns
and tail, settled anywhere that a sufficiently broad surface
presented itself. Having started to run, they ran on
and on and on. The boy and girl followed, their horses
stumbling blindly over the ridges between which the corn
was growing. The grayish brown sod, through which
the matted white roots of the grass showed plainly, lay in
fine lines down the long field, their irregular edges causing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
horses and cattle to go down on their knees frequently as
they ran. But though the cattle sometimes fell, they
were as quickly up and pushed blindly ahead, neither
knowing nor caring where they were going, their only
instinct being to get away.</p>
<p>Not a breath of air was in motion except such as was
stirred by the wings of the grasshoppers or was blown from
the hot nostrils of the harassed cattle. They passed
through the cornfield, over a stubblefield beyond, through
a slough, another stubblefield, and on to the open prairie
of another section of &#8220;Railroad land.&#8221; The boy and
girl made no further attempt to guide them. A cow, with
the tickling feet of half a dozen of these devils of torment
on the end of a bare, wet nose, was in no state of mind to
be argued with, and the tossing horns, threshing about to
free the head from the pests, were to be taken into sober
account. All they could do was to let the maddened
beasts take their own course.</p>
<p>For an hour, helpless to prevent the stampede, desiring
nothing now but to keep the cattle in sight, the weary,
sunbaked children trudged along in the rear of the herd,
following through fields cut and uncut, over the short
grass of the hills or the long bluestem of the hollows, their
horses sweating profusely, their own faces too parched
to emit moisture, conscious only of the business of following
the panting herd and of avoiding the pitfalls under
their horses&#8217; feet.</p>
<p>At last the cattle came to a walk. The heat of the day
and the unusual exertion had told upon them. Occasionally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
a tongue lolled from the mouth of some wearied beast,
but it was not permitted even that respite for long; the
grasshoppers respected no part of the bovine anatomy,
and with an angry snort and an annoyed toss of the
head the tongue would be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The perspiring cattle seemed so fatigued that the despairing
children thought at last that they might be turned
toward home, but though whips and voices were used to
the utmost the nettled beasts could not be made to face
the stinging devils which settled thicker and ever thicker
about them. They came down to a walk, but they walked
doggedly toward the north. At last the sun&#8217;s rays began
to peep through. The air soon cleared, and the scorched
and burning children began to wish for even a cloud of
grasshoppers to protect them from the heat. Wherever
the light fell it disclosed moving masses of locusts which
covered the entire face of the landscape. The teeming
cloud of insects was a pest equal to that of the lice of
Egypt. They overflowed the Kansas prairies like the
lava from Mount Vesuvius, burying vegetation and causing
every living thing to flee from their path.</p>
<p>At last the storm spent itself. The sun came out clear,
and as hot as molten brass. The cattle could hold out
no longer. The swarms which flew up in front of their
moving feet were as unbearable as any that had come from
above. The exhausted beasts gave up and permitted
themselves to be headed toward home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began to think they wouldn&#8217;t stop till they had
reached the State line,&#8221; the girl said with a relieved sigh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
when they were safely started down the first road they
came upon after turning south again.</p>
<p>Luther made no reply. He had stopped the pony and
was watching the inroads of numberless scissor-like
mouths on a stub of corn near the roadside. The tassel
was gone, the edges of the leaves were eaten away, and
lines of hungry insects hung to the centre rib of each
blade, gnawing and cutting at every inch of the stem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; won&#8217;t be a cornstalk left standin&#8217; by night,&#8221; Luther
observed as the girl rode up to see what it was that attracted
his attention. &#8220;Crackie! but I&#8217;m glad pap&#8217;s sold
out. It&#8217;d be no shoes for me this winter if we didn&#8217;t get
away,&#8221; he added, spitefully brushing a grasshopper from
the end of his nose and rubbing the injured member.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face fell at the mention of hard times. Times
were always hard in the Farnshaw home, but she could
never get accustomed to them, and each new phase of the
trouble was a blow. The sensitive child already carried
a load of financial worry which was tugging at every
pleasure her young life craved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t we have any corn at all?&#8221; she cried in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Luther answered dubiously. &#8220;It&#8217;ll
be starvin&#8217; times about here. You better get your folks
t&#8217; sell out and go East too,&#8221; he said, without looking up.</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s fear of financial disaster was eased by the
prospect of &#8220;goin&#8217; East.&#8221; The &#8220;East&#8221; was the fairyland
of her dreams, the childhood&#8217;s home of her father, who was
a good story-teller when he was not irritated, the Mecca
and Medina of all the pilgrimages of all their little world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
To go East was to be a travelled person, to attain distinction,
just the next best thing in fact to being made President
of the United States. To go East was to live near
the timber, where one could wander for hours, days, ages,
in the cool freshness of its shady paths. The sunburned
child, with her jug hanging by a strap from the saddle
horn, had a swift, rapturous vision of alluring, mossy
banks, canopied by rustling leaves, before she was called
back to the stern hills of her native Kansas and the sterner
necessity of forcing a hundred head of maddened cattle
to keep within the confines of an illy defined road.</p>
<p>By the time they had ridden ahead and crowded the
cattle down to the right of way again, the child&#8217;s natural
good sense and business instincts had combined to temporarily
shatter the dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody &#8217;d buy us out if there ain&#8217;t nothing to feed
the cattle,&#8221; she said, watching the boy&#8217;s face eagerly in
the hope that he would reassure her.</p>
<p>When he did not speak, she added, with discouraged
conviction, &#8220;Pa wouldn&#8217;t sell out anyhow; ma&#8217;s been
trying to get him to for a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to. You won&#8217;t be able t&#8217; stay if there&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; t&#8217; feed,&#8221; the lad said with emphasis, and then
added with a giggle, &#8220;I bet th&#8217; Cranes is mad for bein&#8217; in
such a hurry t&#8217; get in. They paid pap th&#8217; money last
night, an&#8217; made &#8217;im promise t&#8217; give possession &#8217;fore t&#8217;morrow
night. Three hundred dollars! Th&#8217; old woman
took it out of &#8217;er stockin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three hundred dollars!&#8221; Lizzie Farnshaw repeated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
whirling her horse about suddenly at the mention of a
sum of money which ran into hundreds. She looked at
the boy enviously. She was but fourteen, and did not
realize that more than three hundred acres of fertile land
had been exchanged for the sum. Her spirits rose as they
turned to follow the cattle again. Perhaps, as Luther
had said, they would have to sell out also. The dream of
going East absorbed her once more. As she dreamed,
however, a shrewd eye was kept on the cattle. As nearly
as possible she lived up to the trust reposed in her. Quick
to serve, sensitive, honest, dependable as she was, these
cattle constituted the point of contact between the developing
girl and her developing philosophy of life. Duty
pointed sternly to the undesired task, and duty was writ
large on the pages of Lizzie Farnshaw&#8217;s monotonous life.
Her hands and face had browned thickly at its bidding,
but though, as she had remarked a couple of hours before,
she should crack like the sunbaked earth beneath her feet,
she would not fail in her obligation to keep the cattle out
of other men&#8217;s fields, and her father out of the primitive
courts where damages could be assessed. Poverty she
had always known, but now they were threatened with a
new and more dreadful form of it than any hitherto encountered,
a fact of which courts took no cognizance.
Hope and fear alternated in her heart as she rode along,
but for the most part the young life in her clung to the
idea of the Eastern trip. Hope springs eternal in the
child heart. Perhaps after all they would have to leave
Kansas, as Luther had said. If only&mdash;&mdash;. In spite of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the arguments of good sense she clung to the idea. She
was glad Luther was there. In her simple way she had
told her plans, her hopes, and her fears to Luther&#8217;s willing
ears ever since she had known him: she did so now. A
Maggie Tulliver in her own family, Luther was the one
compensating feature of her life. Luther not only understood
but was interested. His tallow-candle face and
faded hair were those of the&mdash;in that country&mdash;much
despised Swede, but the child saw the gentle spirit shining
out of his kindly blue eyes. Luther was her oracle, and
she quoted his words so often at home that it was a family
joke.</p>
<p>Luther Hansen was the only preacher to whom Lizzie
Farnshaw ever listened. Her Sundays had been spent on
the prairies from choice. Mrs. Farnshaw mourned over
what she considered her daughter&#8217;s unregenerate condition,
but Mr. Farnshaw was quite willing that the child
should herd the cattle if she preferred it to spending an
hour at &#8220;meetin&#8217;.&#8221; Luther, who also until this year had
herded his father&#8217;s cattle and who usually spent the long
days with the girl, had quaint ways of looking at religious
questions which was a never-ending source of delight and
interest to her. Their problems at home as well as at
school were subjects of common discussion. He had been
the beginning and the end of her social life. Now she
took him into her dream of going away, and discussed her
ideas of the best way of disposing of the stock by sale or
gift, the sort of home she would have with her grandparents,
and pictured, with a vivid imagination, the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and streams she had heard her father describe. If she
only could go! They stopped at every field to watch the
voracious insects, which were eating every green thing
upon which they happened to alight. A turnip patch on
the corner of the Farnshaw place which had been straggling,
but green, when the cattle had passed through it
that afternoon, had not a leaf to show as they returned.
The ground was dotted all over the patch with small holes
where the hungry swarms, not satisfied with the tops, had
followed the stems down into the earth, eating out the
bulbs to the very taproots.</p>
<p>They drove the cattle across to the usual feeding place,
but the grasshoppers flew up in continuous clouds before
every moving object, and it was impossible for them to
eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take them in and shut them up?&#8221;
Luther asked when he saw that the herd was so restless
that the child could not manage them alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa wouldn&#8217;t let me,&#8221; she sighed, and continued
to ride around her charges.</p>
<p>Luther had intended going home long before this, but
he knew that Lizzie could not control the restless cattle,
and so he stayed with her, rather glad of the excuse
to do so. Josiah Farnshaw&#8217;s temper was a matter
of neighbourhood knowledge. A word of explanation
to his father, Luther knew, would be all that he
would need to make the fact of his absence
commendable. He was glad of any excuse which would
leave him with Lizzie Farnshaw for an extra hour, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
was to find that hour disappointing, for the cattle were
restless and kept them both in constant motion.</p>
<p>When at last the time came to corral the stock a new
calamity was discovered. The cattle wandered into the
edge of a field of flax as they neared the barn. Luther,
following them, dropped from the back of his pony and
stopped to examine the grain. The girl was excitedly getting
the straying animals crowded on toward the pens and
it was not till she had the gate shut fast on them that she
could take time to join him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked as she rode up.</p>
<p>The lanky boy, who was really a man, measured the
field slowly with his eye, calculating the damage before he
answered slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kicked it out o&#8217; th&#8217; pods flyin&#8217; through. Must &#8217;a&#8217;
been twenty acres. What made you let it get s&#8217; ripe for?
It ought t&#8217; been cut three days ago, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was out of her saddle in an instant. She walked
into the body of the field somewhat, her face quivering
pitifully as she examined the grain for herself. It was
only too true! The beautiful brown seeds carpeted the
earth around the roots of the flax, but no amount of harvesting
would ever gather so much as a handful. The
crop was a total loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor ma!&#8221; she cried, when convinced beyond a doubt
of the empty bolls. With the eyes of the prematurely old,
she saw the extent of the ruin, and she knew what would
be its effect upon the mother who seldom knew joy.</p>
<p>The loss of the turnips had seemed bad enough, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
while watching the green things about her disappear it
had not occurred to the child that the grasshoppers would
eat the dry and, as Luther had said, overripe stems of the
flax. Still less had it occurred to her that the insignificant
wings and feet of such small things could do damage to an
entire field by merely flying through it.</p>
<p>That flax was of paramount importance in the family
calculations just now. In her considerations of the prospective
move to the East, the price of this flax had figured
largely. Family discussions had centred about that field
for weeks. It was the one definite starting point in the
bickerings about their weak and indefinite plans for the
future. The loss of every other family asset could not
have undone the child&#8217;s faith in the ultimate good of
things so overwhelmingly. She choked back a sob as she
mounted her horse again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor ma!&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Pa told her she could
have the money from the flax to go and see grandma on.
You know grandma&#8217;s old, and they think she can&#8217;t live
through the winter. That&#8217;s one reason why I was so glad
when I thought we were going to have to go East to live.
She don&#8217;t hardly know her own children any more, I
hope ma don&#8217;t know about the flax; She&#8217;ll be sure to have
one of her spells, and she&#8217;s just got over one. Ain&#8217;t it
awful?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther feared she was going to cry, and, man fashion,
prepared to flee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got t&#8217; go, Lizzie,&#8221; he said, and awkwardly held
out his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>All thought of the flax disappeared from the girl&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Luther!&#8221; she exclaimed in new distress, &#8220;won&#8217;t I
ever see you again?&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought was so overwhelming that her tears came
now from quite a different cause, and the frank eyes
threatened to overflow as she stood clasping his bony hand
in hers insistently. &#8220;What will I do without you?&#8221; she
sobbed.</p>
<p>The unexpected question and the unexpected tears had
an uncomfortable effect on the boy. He grew suddenly
embarrassed and drew his hand away.</p>
<p>Some indefinable thing about the action made her
conscious that there was a change in his feelings. It
checked her rising emotions and made her curious. What
was he embarrassed about? The girl stole a look at him,
which left him still more disturbed and uneasy. It was
an intangible thing upon which she could not remark and
yet could not fail to recognize. Luther had never been
awkward in her presence before. Their association had
been of the most offhand and informal character. As a
boy of fifteen he had carried her, a girl of eleven, over
many a snowbank their first winter of school in the Prairie
Home school district. They had herded cattle together,
waded the shallow ponds and hunted for mussel shells,
and until this year they had seen each other daily. This
year Luther had taken a man&#8217;s place in the fields and the
girl had seen him at rare intervals. She was not conscious
of the change which this year of dawning adolescence had
brought to them both. Luther had developed a growing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
need of a razor on his thin, yellow face, while she, four
years younger, had also matured. The outgrown calico
dress she wore was now halfway to her knees, its sleeves
exposed some inches of sunburned wrists, and the scanty
waist disclosed a rapidly rounding form. Young womanhood
was upon her, unknown to her, and but now discovered
by Luther Hansen. For the first time Luther
felt the hesitancy of a youth in the presence of a maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall miss you <i>so!</i>&#8221; the girl said, looking at him,
puzzled by the indefinable something in his manner which
was a new element in their communications.</p>
<p>Her frank curiosity put the boy utterly to rout. The
blood surged to his pale face and pounded in the veins
under his ears, half choking him; it cut short the leave-taking
and left the child bewildered and half hurt.</p>
<p>She watched the calico pony lope away in a cloud of
scurrying grasshoppers and wondered in a child-like way
what could have happened. This abrupt and confused
departure increased the loneliness she felt. He was her
one real friend, and her tears came again as she turned
toward the house.</p>
<p>There was little time given the child to indulge her
feelings, or to speculate upon a friend&#8217;s confusion or adieus,
for a sharp voice summoned her to the house and fresh
duties.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I call you I want you to step spry,&#8221; was the
greeting the child received from the stooped figure putting
the potatoes over the fire to fry, as she entered the door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw had her head tied up in a white cloth;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
&#8220;the spell&#8221; had arrived. It was no time to tell of the loss
of the flax, and Luther&#8217;s going was not mentioned, because
Mrs. Farnshaw shared the public contempt for his nationality
and had failed to get her daughter&#8217;s confidence in
that quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, set this table for me; I&#8217;m clear done out. Did
you ever hear of such a crazy thing as all them hoppers
comin&#8217; down like bees? Your pa&#8217;s gone over to Hansen&#8217;s
t&#8217; see what he thinks. Looks &#8217;s if we&#8217;d be harder up &#8217;n
ever, an&#8217; I thought I&#8217;d done &#8217;bout all th&#8217; savin&#8217; a woman
could do a&#8217;ready. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; get right off t&#8217; mother&#8217;s
soon&#8217;s ever we can sell that flax. If I don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll be havin&#8217;
t&#8217; use th&#8217; money for feed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her daughter made no reply. It was no time, when her
mother was having one of her periodical sick-headaches,
to let it be known that there was no flax to sell. That flax
had been one long series of troublesome worries, to which
the total loss was a fittingly tragic end. The restless
grasshoppers outside were forgotten.</p>
<p>Some weeks before, Mr. Farnshaw had given a grudging
consent to the use of the proceeds from the flax crop for a
trip&#8217; to his wife&#8217;s old home while her mother yet lived.
Josiah Farnshaw&#8217;s temper was an uncertain quantity.
Had Mrs. Farnshaw been wise she would have dropped all
reference to the flax when the promise was obtained. But
Mrs. Farnshaw had to talk; it was her fate. She had
hovered about the field, she had centred her faculties on
the considerations of harvesting, and prices. She laboriously
and obviously collected eggs, skimped the family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
on its supply of butter, and had counted her chickens to
see how many she could sacrifice for the purchase of &#8220;a
decent bit of black.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she sewed upon the premature emblems of her coming
woe, she had discussed the desirability of threshing out of
the shock instead of waiting for the stack to go through
the sweating process; she talked, talked, talked, with an
endless clacking, till her husband fled from her presence or
cut her short with an oath. He wished he had never
planted flax, he wished he had never heard of it, he wished&mdash;he
hardly knew what he did wish, but he was sick of
flax.</p>
<p>Crops of all sorts were shortened by continued drought;
corn would be an utter failure. He had given notes for a
new harvester and other machinery while the prospects
for crops were good, and the knowledge that implement
dealers would collect those notes whether the yield of
grain was equal to their demands or not tightened the set
lines about his naturally stern mouth and irritated a
temper never good at the best. Daily he became more
obstinate and unapproachable.</p>
<p>Josiah Farnshaw was not only obstinate, he was surly.
Nothing could induce him to show any interest in the
flax field after he found that his wife was looking out for
its advantages. If she suggested that they go to examine
it, he was instantly busy. If she asked when he intended
to begin the cutting, he was elaborately indifferent and
replied, &#8220;When its ripe; there&#8217;s plenty of time.&#8221; When
at last the field showed a decided tendency to brown, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
helped a neighbour instead of beginning on Friday, as his
wife urged. Saturday he found something wrong with
the binder. By Saturday night he began to see that the
grain was ripening fast. He was warned and was ready
to actually start the machine early the next day. His
grizzled face concealed the grin it harboured at the idea
of running the harvester on Sunday; he knew Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s
scruples. The flax had ripened, almost overnight,
because of the extreme heat. Torn with anxiety and the
certain knowledge that haste was necessary, Mrs. Farnshaw
quoted scripture and hesitated. Her husband, who
had delayed in all possible ways up to this time, and had
refused to listen to her advice, became suddenly anxious
to do &#8220;that cuttin&#8217;.&#8221; Now that his wife hesitated from
principle, he was intensely anxious to move contrary to
her scruples.</p>
<p>The knowledge that her husband was enjoying her
indecision, and that he was grimly thinking that her religious
scruples would not stand the test, made her even
less able to decide a question than usual.</p>
<p>The game was getting exciting and he let her argue,
urging with pretended indifference that, &#8220;That flax&#8217;s
dead ripe now an&#8217; if it shatters out on th&#8217; ground you kin
blame yourself,&#8221; adding with grim humour, &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; like th&#8217; sound of money t&#8217; bring folks t&#8217; their
senses. It&#8217;s good as a pinch of pepper under th&#8217; nose of a
bulldog.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was everything to point that way, but a woman
and a mother must vindicate her claims to religion, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
Mrs. Farnshaw refused to give her consent to the Sunday
harvesting.</p>
<p>Torn between her desire to save every grain of the precious
crop and the fear of a hell that burned with fire and
brimstone, her husband&#8217;s scorn did what neither had been
able to do. Mrs. Farnshaw forbade the machine being
taken to the field, and then cried herself into a headache.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do as you please; it&#8217;s your lookout, but I tell you It&#8217;ll
be a sick lookin&#8217; field by to-morrow mornin&#8217;,&#8221; was Mr.
Farnshaw&#8217;s final shot.</p>
<p>When her decision was finally reached, Mr. Farnshaw
became alarmed. He knew he had let the flax go too long
uncut. He had half believed in the reasons he had given
for delay up to this point, but suddenly realizing that the
overripe grain would suffer great loss if left another day
in the hot sun, he reasoned with real earnestness that it
must be cut if it were to be saved. His wife, thoroughly
convinced that he was still tormenting her and that he
would never let her hear the last of the matter if she gave
up, closed her lips down firmly and declined to allow it to
be done.</p>
<p>All this the child had heard argued out that morning.
It was a cruel position in which to place one of her years.
Part of it she had comprehended, part had escaped
her, but she was sensitive to the atmosphere of suffering.
The details of past elements in the tragedy she could not
be expected to understand. The stunted, barren life of
her mother was but half guessed. What child could
know of the heartsick longing for affection and a but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
little understood freedom, the daily coercion, the refusal
of her husband to speak kindly or to meet her eye with a
smile?</p>
<p>The sorely puzzled and bewildered woman thought affection
was withheld from her because of something done
or undone, and strove blindly to achieve it by acts, not
knowing that acts have little, if anything, to do with
affection. She strove daily to win love, not knowing that
love is a thing outside the power to win or bestow. Had
she had understanding she would have spared the child
with whom she worked; instead, she talked on with her
dreary whine, morbidly seeking a sympathy of which she did
not know how to avail herself when it was so plainly hers.</p>
<p>With a lump in her throat of which the mother did not
even suspect, Lizzie Farnshaw set the table, cut the bread,
brought the water, &#8220;put up the chairs,&#8221; and, when her
father came from the stable, slipped out to where he was
washing for supper and whispered about the flax, asking
him not to mention it while her mother was suffering with
the headache.</p>
<p>The news was not news to Josiah Farnshaw, who had
examined the field anxiously as he had returned from
Hansen&#8217;s. Sobered by the loss, he was less disagreeable
than usual and only pushed his daughter out of his way
as he reached around her for the sun-cracked bar of yellow
laundry soap with which to wash his hands. Thankful
to have the unpleasant but important matter, as she
thought, safely attended to, the child returned to help lift
the meal to the bare kitchen table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>The illy lighted room, with its one small window, was
dim and dismal in the dusk of evening. In spite of the
added heat it would produce, the child decided that a
light was necessary.</p>
<p>After the kerosene lamp was lighted, she turned to see
if her mother needed her help again. The crooked blaze
ran up unexpectedly and blacked the cracked chimney on
one side with a soot so thick that one half of the room was
soon in semi-darkness. Mrs. Farnshaw took it fretfully
in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you trim it when you see it runnin&#8217; up that
way?&#8221; she demanded querulously, poking at the lopsided
and deeply charred wick with a sliver obtained from the
side of the wood-box.</p>
<p>Her ministrations were not very successful, however,
for when the chimney was replaced it ran up on the other
side, and in the end her daughter had to prosecute a search
for the scissors and cut the wick properly. As they worked
over the ill-smelling light, Albert, the youngest of the three
children of the household, burst into the kitchen crying
excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma, did you know that th&#8217; flax was all whipped out of
th&#8217; pods on to the ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw, who had received the lamp from her
daughter&#8217;s hand, let it fall on the edge of an upturned plate
in her excitement, and then, seeing what she had done,
fumbled blindly in a terrified effort to right it before
it should go over. The cracked chimney fell from its
moorings, and, striking a teacup, spattered broken glass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
over the table like hailstones. The entire family scrambled
to save the lamp itself from a similar fate and were
plunged into darkness by the girl blowing out its flame to
save an explosion.</p>
<p>The excitement of the moment served, temporarily, to
lessen the blow of Albert&#8217;s announcement, but by the
time &#8220;a dip&#8221; had been constructed the full weight of the
disaster had fallen upon the defeated and despairing
woman, and to protect her from the taunts of the head of
the house, Lizzie induced her to go to bed, where she
sobbed throughout the night.</p>
<p>The next day was hot and windy. The grasshoppers,
unable to fly in a strong wind, clung to the weeds, to the
dry grass, the stripped branches of the half-grown trees,
to the cattle and hogs upon which they happened to
alight, and even to people themselves, unless brushed off.</p>
<p>Lizzie took the cattle out to the usual grazing ground,
but there was no Luther to help, and the grasshoppers
made the lives of the restless animals so unendurable that
in real alarm, lest they run away again, she took them
home, preferring her father&#8217;s wrath to the experience of
getting them back if they should get beyond her control.
Fortune favoured her. Unable to endure the demonstrations
of grief at home, her father had taken himself
to a distant neighbour&#8217;s to discuss the &#8220;plague of locusts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind blew a gale throughout the day, sweeping
remorselessly over the unobstructed hillsides. Unable
to fly, the helpless insects hugged the earth while the gale
tore over the Kansas prairies with a fearful velocity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
With feminine instinct, every female grasshopper burrowed
into the dry earth, making a hole which would receive
almost her entire body back of her wings and legs.
The spring sod, half rotted and loosened from the grass
roots, furnished the best lodgment. In each hole, as deep
down as her body could reach, her pouch of eggs was
deposited.</p>
<p>No attempt was made to cover the hole, and by night
the sod presented a honeycombed appearance never before
seen by the oldest settlers. Having performed
nature&#8217;s functions, and provided for the propagation of
their kind, the lately fecund grasshoppers were hungry
when the act was over. Not a spear of anything green
was left. The travel-worn horde had devoured everything
in sight the day before. Evening closed in upon a
restless and excited swarm of starving insects, but they
were unable to fly at night or while the wind was blowing.</p>
<p>It was necessary to find food; hunger&#8217;s pangs may not
be suffered long by creatures whose active life is numbered
in weeks. The high wind had cooled the air and made
the locusts stupid and sleepy, but when the next morning
the wind had fallen, and the sun had warmed their bodies,
as fast as they were able all were on the wing, headed for
the north. The air was calm, and by ten o&#8217;clock they
were away in swarms, leaving ruin and desolation to show
that they had sojourned in the land.</p>
<p>The situation was truly desperate. Cattle, horses, and
hogs were without food of any sort. Many families were
new to the country and had depended upon sod-corn for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
the winter&#8217;s supply of provender for both man and beast.
Mr. Farnshaw, being one of the older residents, had
grown a crop of wheat, so that his bread was assured;
but the herd of cattle which had been his delight was now
a terrorizing burden. Cattle and horses could not live
on wheat, and there was no hay because of the dry weather.
What was to be done?</p>
<p>That night the neighbours held a consultation at the
Farnshaw house, where grizzled and despairing men discussed
the advisability of &#8220;goin&#8217; East,&#8221; and ways and
means of getting there. The verdict was strongly in favour
of going.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw brightened. Perhaps, after all, she
would get away from these wind-blown prairies, where no
shade offered its protecting presence against a sun which
took life and spirits out of the pluckiest of them. Even
more childish than the daughter at her side, Mrs. Farnshaw
clapped her hands with joy as she leaned forward
expectantly to address her new neighbour.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can only get t&#8217; my mother&#8217;s, I won&#8217;t care for
nothin&#8217; after that. My heart goes out t&#8217; Mrs. Crane.
Think of all that good money goin&#8217; t&#8217; them Swedes! You
just better pocket your loss an&#8217; get away while you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; too, then, Farnshaw?&#8221; the new neighbour
asked.</p>
<p>All eyes turned upon Mr. Farnshaw, who had not as
yet expressed himself on either side. These neighbours
had asked to assemble in his house because his kitchen afforded
more room than any other house in the vicinity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
the kitchen being a large room with no beds in it to take
up floor space.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw realized as soon as the question was
asked that her joy had been premature.</p>
<p>Josiah Farnshaw sat with his chair tilted back on two
legs against the wall, snapping the blade of his pocket
knife back and forth as he considered what he was going
to say in reply. He felt all eyes turned in his direction
and quite enjoyed the suspense. Mr. Farnshaw was an
artist in calculating the suspense of others. He gave
them plenty of time to get their perspective before he
replied. At last he shut the blade of the knife down
ostentatiously, replaced it in his trousers&#8217; pocket, and
announced slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, as for me and mine, I think we&#8217;ll stay right
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw gave a despairing, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and covered
her face with her hands to strangle back her tears. Her
one hope had been that poverty would accomplish what
the flax had failed to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I thought you said there&#8217;d be nothin&#8217; t&#8217; feed
an&#8217; you&#8217;d have t&#8217;,&#8221; said a man whose shaggy whiskers
had not seen a comb that year. &#8220;What&#8217;ll you do?
You can&#8217;t see things starve!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you was strong for goin&#8217;. What&#8217;ll you do
with all your stock?&#8221; another said, and all bent forward
and waited for his answer as if he could find a way out of
the tangle for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it.&#8221; Again he paused, enjoying the suspense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
that his silence created. Mr. Farnshaw was not
popular, but he had more stock than all his simple neighbours
put together and was conscious that money, or its
equivalent, had weight. &#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; he repeated
to add emphasis to his opinion. &#8220;What is a man to do?
You folks that have nothin&#8217; but your teams an&#8217; wagons
can load th&#8217; family in an&#8217; get away. How&#8217;d I feel &#8217;bout
th&#8217; time that I got t&#8217; th&#8217; Missouri River if I knowed all
them hogs an&#8217; cattle was layin&#8217; around here too weak t&#8217;
get up cause they hadn&#8217;t been fed?&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped his argument into the midst of them and
then sat back and enjoyed its effect. He had intended
to go till ten minutes previous. The argument sounded
good to him now, however. It put him on a higher basis
with himself, in spite of the fact that it had only popped
into his head while he was clicking his knife blade. He conceived
a new liking for himself. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see as your stayin&#8217; helps anything if you ain&#8217;t
got nothin&#8217; t&#8217; feed,&#8221; was the reiterated objection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mr. Farnshaw replied, careful not to look in
his wife&#8217;s direction, &#8220;I was for goin&#8217; at first, but I&#8217;ve
listened t&#8217; you folks an&#8217; I&#8217;ve come t&#8217; th&#8217; conclusion that
you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; better yourselves any. If you go East,
You&#8217;ll have t&#8217; come back here in th&#8217; spring, or live on day&#8217;s
work there&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll take my chances right here.
It&#8217;s a long lane that has no turn. Grasshoppers can&#8217;t stay
always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you do if all them eggs hatch out an&#8217; eat th&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
crops in th&#8217; spring?&#8221; the new neighbour asked, determined
to look on all sides of the question before he decided to give
up his recently purchased farm, and glad of this opportunity
to get the opinions of his fellow sufferers on that
particular phase of his unexpected calamity. &#8220;What&#8217;ll
you do with all that bunch of cattle, anyhow?&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll share what I&#8217;ve got with th&#8217; stuff, an&#8217; if part of it
dies I&#8217;ll drag it out on th&#8217; hill t&#8217; rot; th&#8217; rest I&#8217;ll stay by,&#8221;
was the stubborn reply. &#8220;As for them eggs a-hatchin&#8217;,
they&#8217;ll be good ones if they can stand a Kansas winter;
they&#8217;ll do a blamed sight better&#8217;n any eggs Mrs. Farnshaw
gethers in. They&#8217;d better go south.&#8221;</p>
<p>This raised a laugh. The grim humour of anything,
that could get away, spending a winter in Kansas, appealed
to these grizzly pioneers, who struggled with the
question of fuel in a country where there was little natural
timber, and coal must be paid for before it was burned.
But all their arguments would not turn him from his
course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wife&#8217;s turrible set on goin&#8217;, Farnshaw,&#8221; one of
the men said to him as they went to the stable for their
horses when the meeting broke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women&#8217;s always wantin&#8217; things,&#8221; was the indifferent
reply. &#8220;Say, you&#8217;ve got a stack of wheat straw. What&#8217;ll
you take for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the house the sympathetic daughter helped her
mother prepare for bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought sure to-night we&#8217;d get to go,&#8221; the child said.
&#8220;If you could get back East you might get to stay; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
then you wouldn&#8217;t have to cry so much,&#8221; she added as she
picked up the abandoned clothing her mother had left
lying on the floor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw, who was turning the same matter over
disconsolately as she sat on the side of the bed, shook her
head with the bitter certainty that her fate would pursue
her, and replied hopelessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t make no difference, I guess, Lizzie. He&#8217;d
be there, an&#8217; it&#8217;d be just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the girl, who was naturally reflective, carried with
her to the loft overhead that night a new idea: that it
was not the place, but the manner in which lives were
lived, which mattered.</p>
<p>The preparations for the coming of that winter were
the strangest ever witnessed in a farming community.
Never had any man known fuel to be so scarce. Cornstalks,
which were usually staple articles for fuel in that
country, had been eaten almost to the very ground, but
the stubs were gathered, the dirt shaken from them, and
they were then carted to the house. Rosin weeds were collected
and piled in heaps. The dried dung of cattle,
scattered over the grazing lands, and called &#8220;buffalo
chips,&#8221; was stored in long ricks, also, and used sparingly,
for even this simple fuel was so scarce as to necessitate
care in its use.</p>
<p>To keep out the driving winds, the houses were banked
with sods and earth halfway to the roofs. With so little
material for keeping warm, and that of the lightest variety,
it was necessary to make the living quarters impervious to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the never-ceasing winds which tore at the thin walls of
the unprotected houses that sheltered such folk as were
hardy enough to remain.</p>
<p>It was impossible to build sheds for all the stock, so
the hogs were allowed to swarm under the feet of the horses
tied in the straw stable, and many and sad were the accidents
to the smaller animals. It was soon clear that not
many of them could be carried through till the spring.
Seeing that they lost weight rapidly, as many as were full
grown were killed and their flabby carcasses salted away
to be eaten.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the grasshoppers had not arrived in Kansas
till after the small grain had been nearly all cut, so that
there was considerable oat and wheat straw in the country.
Mr. Farnshaw bargained for every straw stack he
could find, but straw was a poor substitute for the corn
and hay to which the cattle were accustomed, and as the
weeks lengthened into months, and winter closed in, the
unprotected cattle grew thinner and ever thinner. Corn
was quoted in the markets at a dollar a bushel, but in fact
was not to be had at any price. Iowa had had a drought,
and Illinois was the nearest base of supplies, and as it was
generally known that there was no money west of the
Missouri River, no grain was sent to Kansas.</p>
<p>Finding that the horses did not thrive on the straw
alone, and knowing that wheat would very quickly kill
them, Mr. Farnshaw put away a sufficient amount of
oats for seed and then carefully portioned out the rest to
be fed to four of his best broodmares, hoping to be able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
put in the spring crops with them as well as to save the
coming colts of two. The rest, he decided, must take
their chances on getting through the winter alive.</p>
<p>The family food consisted largely of bread and the
slabs of thin meat, with a sort of coffee made from browned
rye. As a &#8220;company dish&#8221; there was a scanty supply of
sweet corn, dried before the drought had cut the crop
short. There were no eggs, because the chickens had
sickened from eating grasshoppers in the fall and nearly
all had died. The few hens which remained clung to
the limbs of the half-grown cottonwood trees throughout
the long winter nights, and found barely food enough during
the day to keep life in their fuzzy bodies, which could
not even furnish the oil necessary to lay their feathers
smooth, much less foster the growth of eggs.</p>
<p>Josiah Farnshaw secretly questioned the propriety of
having remained in that desolate territory when, as spring
approached, the shrunken cows died one after another in
giving birth to the calves which had matured in their
slowly perishing bodies, but he made no sign or admission
of the fact.</p>
<p>It was a season of gloom such as our frontier states had
never known, and to add to the general depression there
was a growing conviction that the hatching of the grasshoppers&#8217;
eggs when warm weather came would complete
the famine.</p>
<p>To support his action in refusing to go East, Josiah
Farnshaw asserted stubbornly that the frost of their hard
winter would certainly kill the larvae of the locusts. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
persistent was his attitude that at short intervals throughout
the entire winter rumours that &#8220;th&#8217; hopper eggs is
dead &#8217;s doornails&#8221; stirred the community and set its
members to making tests in a vain endeavour to establish
their truth. Pieces of earth, honeycombed with the
tiny nests, would be placed near the fire and kept at as
regular a degree of warmth as possible, the condition of the
eggs would be noted carefully, and in a short time the
hopes of the anxious pioneers would be dashed to the
ground by wriggling little insects climbing cheerfully out
of their winter quarters and hopping about in a vain search
for something green to live upon. Often, in sheer desperation,
the harassed settler would sweep the hatching
brood into the fire, remarking as he did so, &#8220;Burnin&#8217;s too
good for such pests,&#8221; and always fear gripped the heart.
If the crops in spring were eaten, other homes must be
sought, and all knew that the weakened horses were unfit
for travel. In fact, no team in that entire country was fit
to travel far or fast, except the two which Mr. Farnshaw
groomed and fed so carefully for the sake of the spring
work and the much desired colts.</p>
<p>The depression and worries of the Farnshaw home increased
the spirit of contention and distrust of its guardians.
The husband daily grew surlier and more
unpleasant and the wife more lachrymose and subject to
&#8220;spells.&#8221; The children learned to avoid the presence of
either parent as much as possible, and to look outside the
home for the joy childhood demands. The chores were
heavy and difficult, but could at least be performed in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
open light of God&#8217;s great out-of-doors, where the imagination
could people the world with pleasant features and
pleasant prospects.</p>
<p>The cattle were driven daily to the ponds, half a mile
away, for water, and if the ice was thick and the axe-handle
benumbing to the mittened hands as they chopped
the holes for the tottering animals to drink from, there was
the prospect of a slide on the uncut portions of the ice
later; and as the plucky youngsters followed the cattle
home they dreamed of skates to be obtained in the dim
future, and tried to run fast enough to keep warm. The
blessing of childhood is that it cannot be cheated of its
visions, and the blood of adolescence was coursing riotously
through the veins of the daughter of the Farnshaw
house. If her hands were cold when she returned to the
barnyard, after watering the cattle, she beat them about
her shoulders or held them against the shrunken flank of
some dumb animal, or blew her breath through the fingers
of her knitted mittens; but her thoughts were of other
things.</p>
<p>It is an old saying that &#8220;God helps them who help
themselves,&#8221; and in the case of Lizzie Farnshaw the axiom
became a living truth. While the rest of her family suffered
and magnified their sufferings, she, by a vivid
imagination, placed herself in the path of fortune and
obtained the thing she demanded. The simple country
schoolhouse that year, dreary and cheerless enough to
the pert Miss who had come out from Topeka to teach
there, and incidentally to collect twenty-five dollars a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
month from the school board, was to be the scene of the
initial change in Lizzie Farnshaw&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Verily, God helps them who help themselves, and Lizzie
Farnshaw proved the old saw by laying hold of and absorbing
every new idea and mannerism of which the new
teacher was arrogantly possessed&mdash;absorbed them, but
transmuted them, winnowing out the coarse, the sarcastic,
the unkind, and making of what was left a substance of
finer fibre.</p>
<p>The number of children in the Prairie Home school that
year was limited to five, the rest having departed for the
indefinable land known as the &#8220;East.&#8221; Three of these
children came from the Farnshaw home and the other two
from the new neighbours, the Cranes, on the Hansen place.</p>
<p>Sadie Crane hated the new teacher with all the might
that her pinched little twelve-year-old body could bring to
bear. She saw only the snippish, opinionated, young
peacock, and the self-assurance which came from the
empty-headed ability to tie a ribbon well. She was so
occupied with resenting the young teacher&#8217;s feeling of vast
superiority that she failed to understand, as did the Farnshaw
child, that along with all that vainglorious assumption
went a real knowledge of some things with which it
was valuable to become acquainted.</p>
<p>To the spiteful Crane child the schoolma&#8217;am was &#8220;stuck-up,&#8221;
while to the imaginative daughter of the Farnshaw
house she was a bird of paradise, and though Lizzie was
conscious that the teacher&#8217;s voice was harsh, and her air
affected, the child reached out like a drowning man toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
this symbol of the life she coveted. To her the new teacher
was a gift from heaven itself.</p>
<p>This young girl from Topeka brought into activity every
faculty the sensitive, ambitious child possessed.</p>
<p>Lizzie Farnshaw laid hold, with a strong hand, upon
every blessing which came in her way. She knew that
the foppish young thing at the teacher&#8217;s desk was &#8220;stuck-up,&#8221;
but Lizzie was willing that she should be whatever she
chose, so long as it was possible to live near her, to study
her, and to become like the best that was in her.</p>
<p>The teacher&#8217;s matter-of-fact assumption that no self-respecting
person failed to obtain a high-school education
was a good thing for the country girl, however overdrawn
it might be. Lizzie Farnshaw listened and built air-castles.
To this one child, out of that entire community,
the idea appealed alluringly. But for her castles in Spain
she must have burst with her unexpressed desires. To
add fuel to the fires of her fancy, Mr. Farnshaw also fell
under the fascinations of the school teacher and boasted
in the bosom of his family that &#8220;Lizzie&#8217;s just as smart as
that Topeka girl any day,&#8221; and when his daughter began
to talk hopefully about teaching school it appealed to the
father&#8217;s pride, and he encouraged her dreams. He had
been the leading man in the community since coming to
Kansas because of the number of cattle he had been able
to accumulate. A small legacy had aided in that accumulation,
and it appealed to his pride to have his daughter&#8217;s
intellectual ambitions adding to the general family importance.
Pride is an important factor in the lives of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
all, but to the children of the farm it is an ambrosia,
which once sipped is never forgotten and to obtain
which many strange sacrifices will be made. Mr. Farnshaw
usually regarded a request from his children as a
thing to be denied promptly, and always as a matter for
suspicion. Yet here he was, considering soberly, yea
pleasurably, a move involving money, at a time when
money was more than usually scarce. His assent was
even of such a nature as to deceive both himself and the
child into thinking that it was being done for her benefit!</p>
<p>The young girl received a new impetus toward improvement.
The family began to regard her as a member set
apart, as one from whom special things were to be expected.
From being just comfortably at the head of her
classes, she became more ambitious, reached over into
new territory, and induced the teacher to create new
classes for her benefit. The subjects required for the
examination of teachers were added to those usually carried.
There was a real purpose in her efforts now, and
the smoky kerosene lamp burned stubbornly till late
hours.</p>
<p>The new teacher not only listened to recitations but
appealed to the artistic in the newly developing woman.
She rolled her hair from neck to brow in a &#8220;French twist&#8221;
and set on the top of it an &#8220;Alsatian bow,&#8221; which stood
like gigantic butterfly wings across her proud head. The
long basque of her school dress was made after the newest
pattern and had smoke-pearl buttons, in overlapping
groups of three, set on each side of its vest front. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
skirt of this wonderful dress was &#8220;shirred&#8221; and hung in
graceful festoons between the rows of gatherings, and was
of an entirely new style. Last, but not least, the teacher&#8217;s
feet were shod in &#8220;side laces,&#8221; the first pair of a new kind
of shoes, destined to become popular, which laced on the
inside of the ankle instead of on the top as we have them
now. Of all her stylish attractions this was the most
absorbing. &#8220;Fool shoes,&#8221; Sadie Crane called them, and
her little black eyes twinkled with a consuming spite when
she mentioned them, but the ambitious Farnshaw child,
reaching out for improvement and change, coveted them,
and preened her own feathers, and mimicked, and dreamed.
She accepted the shoes just as she accepted the teacher&#8217;s
other attributes: they were better than her own.</p>
<p>To be better than her own&mdash;that was the measure of
Lizzie Farnshaw&#8217;s demand. If the shoes, the clothing,
the manners, the ideas, were better than her own they
were worthy of honest consideration. The teacher&#8217;s
tongue was sharp and her criticisms ruthless, but they
had elements of truth in them, and even when they were
directed against the child herself they were a splendid
spur. The young girl copied her manners, her gait, and
her vocabulary. She watched her own conversation to
see that she did not say &#8220;have went&#8221; and &#8220;those kind&#8221;;
she became observant of the state of her finger-nails; if
she had to lace her shoes with twine string, she blackened
the string with soot from the under side of the stove lids,
and polished her shoes from the same source.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw, broken with the cold, the privations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
of the long winter, and the growing disappointments of
her domestic life, saw nothing but overdressing and foolishness
in her daughter&#8217;s new attention to the details of
personal appearance. Burdened with her inability to
furnish the clothes the family needed, she complained
monotonously over every evidence of the young girl&#8217;s
desire to beautify herself. When the mother&#8217;s complaints
became unendurable, the father usually growled out a
stern, &#8220;Let the child alone,&#8221; but for the most part the
growing girl lived a life apart from her family, thought
along different lines, and built about the future a wall
they could never climb, and over whose rim they would
rarely, if ever, catch a glimpse of the world within. No
life, however hard, could ever tame that spirit, or grind
its owner into an alien groove after that year of imaginative
castle building.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>BRUSHING UP TO GO TO TOPEKA</h3>
</div>

<p>With the opening of spring and the coming of the
young grass, the handful of cattle that had not
died of starvation began to look healthier. A
shipment of seed corn for planting, and even a stinted
amount for feed, had been sent from the East in March.
But for that donation even the work horses must have
succumbed. Josiah Farnshaw had the best horses in the
country and was suspected of having had far more help
than he had really received. The two teams he had
favoured all winter against the seeding season were the
envy of all. Some of the old neighbours, after a winter
spent with the wife&#8217;s relatives in the East, had decided to
return and take the chances of the grasshopper-ridden
Middle West, and had come with horses able to drag the
plow, but, worn from travel, most of them were practically
useless.</p>
<p>There was a lull after the small grain was in the ground.
The menacing eggs of the grasshoppers began to hatch as
the sun warmed the earth. It was a period of intense
anxiety. So many months had been spent in alternate
intervals of hope and fear that now, since the test was
actually and immediately to be made, the tension was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
terrific. Men rose as soon as the first light of day appeared
and went to examine the tender grain, without
which they could not remain upon the land which had
cost so dear in the suffering of the winter just past.</p>
<p>A surprise was in store for them. The young insects
matured rapidly. While they appeared in swarms, it was
noticed that they disappeared immediately upon hatching.</p>
<p>Kansas began to get its breath.</p>
<p>Never was promise of crops more encouraging. There
was a distinct note of reassurance and hopefulness in the
air. What became of the grasshoppers nobody knew
exactly, but they went almost as fast as they hatched.
Some shook their heads and said, &#8220;Wait till hot weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Josiah Farnshaw moved steadily ahead with his planting.
He announced that he had faith in Kansas&mdash;had
always had&mdash;he&#8217;d stand on the burning deck! While
others hesitated, he took advantage of wind and weather
to get his crops in the ground. He had been right all
along. He did not propose &#8220;to be run off of the land he
had homesteaded and set with trees by any durned little
bugs he&#8217;d ever come across.&#8221; It was necessary to be up
and doing if a man was going to provide for a family.</p>
<p>Now this assertion proved to be true, for the agent of
the harvester company visited him and requested payment
of the notes given the year before. The agent was
gracious when the inability to pay was explained. He
would renew the paper if it could be secured by the land.
There was no hurry about payment, but it was necessary
for the details to be finished up in a business-like manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
The thing looked simple enough. It was a just debt and
Mr. Farnshaw intended to pay it. He&#8217;d as soon it was
secured by the land as any other way. The details were
soon arranged.</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw agreed to meet the agent in Colebyville,
the nearest town, the next day, and have the papers made
out. After the agent was gone Mr. Farnshaw went to the
house to inform his wife that she was to go to town and
attach her name to the document.</p>
<p>The storm of protest was expected, and when Mrs.
Farnshaw broke out with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, pa, you ain&#8217;t never goin&#8217; t&#8217; mortgage th&#8217; farm,
are you?&#8221; he answered surlily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I be, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t want no words about it neither,&#8221;
and walked determinedly out of the house, leaving his
wife to cry out her fears with her children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have where to lay our heads, soon,&#8221; she announced
bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen somethin&#8217; of th&#8217; mortgage
business an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never seen any of &#8217;em free from payin&#8217;
interest afterward.&#8221; This was no mere personal quarrel.
Her children distinguished that. This was real, definite
trouble.</p>
<p>Accustomed as the child was to her mother&#8217;s woes, Lizzie
Farnshaw was moved to unusual demonstrations by
the quality of the outburst of tears which followed the
words, and said impulsively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind, ma, I&#8217;m going to teach school in
another year, and I&#8217;ll help pay the interest; and we&#8217;ll get
out of debt, too, somehow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re
willin&#8217; t&#8217; help out. I had thought maybe you&#8217;d get me
one of them new nubies after you got some money of your
own.&#8221; She went into the other room to lay out the black
dress, which death had sanctified some months before,
for use on the morrow. The opportunity to wear the
emblems of mourning turned her childish mind away from
the object of her journey, and left her as unconscious as
the young girl herself that the mortgage had extended
from the land to the lives of herself and her husband, and
that in that promise it had laid its withering hand on the
future of her child as well.</p>
<p>The promise of assistance had been lightly given; unearned
money is always easily spent; besides, a teacher&#8217;s
salary seemed rolling wealth to the girl who had never
had a whole dollar in her life. The question of paying the
next year&#8217;s interest was for the time settled. The next
morning the healthy young mind was much more largely
concerned with the appearance of her mother in the new
black dress than with either the mourning it represented
or the mortgage which occasioned its presence. She
sensed dimly that a mortgage was a calamity, but her
vigorous youth refused to concern itself for long with a
disaster so far removed as the next year.</p>
<p>But though calamity might pursue Lizzie Farnshaw on
one hand, true to her innate nature she handled fate in so
masterful a manner that even poverty could not cheat her
youth of all its prerogatives. In order to sufficiently nourish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the teams which must be used in seeding, Josiah Farnshaw
had been obliged to use a part of his seed corn for
feed. In despair at the thought of not being able to plant
all the land under cultivation, he was overjoyed to hear
that a farmer by the name of Hornby, who lived twenty
miles or more to the south, had a new and desirable variety
which he was trying to exchange for cows with young
calves by their sides. A calf was selected from their
diminished herd, its mother tied behind the wagon which
held it, and Lizzie taken along to assist in driving. The
journey, though begun in early morning, was a tedious
one, for the cow fretted, the day was hot, and the footsore
and weary child was worn out long before the Hornby
place was reached. It was after nine o&#8217;clock when they
did arrive, the last five miles having been made with the
added burden of a horse which seemed not at all well. Mr.
Farnshaw would not even go into the house to eat supper,
but asked the farmer to see that Lizzie was put to bed at
once, while he remained with the sick horse. The best
team had been chosen for this trip, in spite of the near
approach of foaling time for one of the mares, because the
other horses were too reduced by lack of food to drive so
far.</p>
<p>After eating a bowl of bread and milk the tired child
was taken to her room by Mrs. Hornby, and in spite
of the ruffled curtains which adorned the windows and
the other evidences of taste and refinement about her,
she was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>The next morning at daybreak the household of Nathan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Hornby was astir. The first object upon which Lizzie&#8217;s
eyes fell was Susan Hornby herself, who had come to call
her to breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father took one of our horses and started right
off home this morning. The one that was sick last night
died and left a little colt. He said he thought he had
better get the other one home at once, so he took ours.
Come right into our room to wash and comb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lizzie was on her feet instantly and followed her hostess
into the next room, making love to the neat white bows
of her hostess&#8217; apron-strings as she went. What did she
care about her father&#8217;s departure without her when she
could wash her face in a white bowl whose pitcher stood
beside the washstand, and comb her hair before a looking-glass
&#8220;where you could see your head and your belt at the
same time?&#8221; But the combing was destined to be a lengthy
process, for before the child had pulled her comb through
the first lock attacked she saw reflected beside her face in
that mirror an old-fashioned, black walnut secretary <i>full
of books</i>! Lizzie Farnshaw had never seen a dozen books
in one house in her life except school books, and here were
rows of books that didn&#8217;t look like any she had ever seen.
She took her comb and walked over to the bookcase where
she could read the titles and comb at the same time, the
spacious mirror, two whole feet in length, being forgotten
in this much more desirable gift of fortune.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby&#8217;s eyes twinkled with delight. In the
five years she had been in Kansas she had never been able
to persuade any one to read with her. Here was a kindred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
spirit. She looked at the fifteen-year-old girl and was
anxious to know how it happened that she was interested
in books at her time of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like to read?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was repeated, and once more she asked it
before the child heard her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you do,&#8221; she laughed, answering her own question.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have some good times before your father
comes back for you. Come on to breakfast now&mdash;the
men are waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lizzie Farnshaw fell naturally into her improved surroundings.
The educating processes of reforming her
language that year had also tended to improve the girl
in other ways and it was with her straight brown hair
gathered into neat braids, clean finger-nails, and a feeling
of general self-respect that she approached Susan Hornby&#8217;s
white-clothed table and was introduced to Mr.
Hornby and the hired men who were already seated
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right glad t&#8217; see you. I been feedin&#8217; th&#8217; colt. It&#8217;s
about as likely a specimine as you be,&#8221; was Nathan Hornby&#8217;s
salutation, and his handclasp was as hearty as his
stubby fingered, hairy hands could make it.</p>
<p>Lizzie slipped quietly into her chair at his side, and stole
a glance up at him again. All through the meal he found
her eyes turning toward him curiously, and at last he said
good-naturedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll know you next time whether you do me or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remark was a random one and meant nothing at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
all, except that he had been conscious of her close attention,
but something in the way her gaze was withdrawn
showed that whatever she had been thinking she wished
to conceal it, and in the end it made Nathan Hornby
really uncomfortable. The fact of the matter was that
Nathan&#8217;s language did not fit his surroundings. Susan
Hornby&#8217;s house was in advance of the country in which
they lived, while her husband fitted the pioneer life he had
chosen. Of this fact neither husband nor wife seemed to
be conscious. Nathan was ten years older than the woman
he had married. In accepting him she had accepted him
as he was; later she had grown, but to her he remained
the same; he was just Nathan, and needed no analysis.
They lived and loved, and radiated the harmony which
was theirs. The incongruities of their union were evident
to this child, who was supersensitive about grammatical
constructions, but their harmony was to be one of the
strong lessons of her life. Lizzie was accustomed to ungrammatical
language at home, but the atmosphere of
this house made ignorance of good form noticeable. She
liked Mr. Hornby, but she wondered a little about his
association with his wife and her home. She went with
him to see the colt after breakfast and remarked upon his
neat barnyard in a manner which lifted the cloud upon
his face; he had had a feeling that he did not somehow
come up to her expectations.</p>
<p>The little colt nosed about his hand looking for food,
and Nathan laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like th&#8217; human critter o&#8217; that age&mdash;wants t&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
try everything in its mouth,&#8221; he said, trying to find a
topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Again Nathan Hornby caught a flicker of surprise in
Lizzie Farnshaw&#8217;s eye, and again he was disconcerted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what I done t&#8217; set that child t&#8217; lookin&#8217; at me
so funny?&#8221; he asked himself as he went to the field later,
and being big-hearted and ignorant was unaware that a
man could hamstring himself by an ungrammatical phrase.</p>
<p>All day Susan Hornby read with the young girl and
questioned her to get into touch with her life and thought,
and when night came was wildly enthusiastic about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nate, she&#8217;s worth a lift,&#8221; she said to her husband after
Lizzie had again been tucked into bed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take her
with us to Topeka this fall and put her into the high
school. She&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s just the age our Katie would have
been. She says some teacher told her she was ready for
the high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait till I&#8217;m elected, Sue,&#8221; Nathan replied, and
then, seeing Susan&#8217;s face cloud over with disappointment,
added more cheerfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t care if you have the child, but you
mustn&#8217;t get to countin&#8217; on this thing. That&#8217;s th&#8217;
trouble with these here fool politics: they get folks t&#8217;
countin&#8217; on things that can&#8217;t come around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long after his wife was asleep, however, he mused upon
the prospects of going to Topeka, and for her sake he
wanted to go. Nathan Hornby always spoke of his
chances of being elected to the legislature of his state
deprecatingly. He swaggered and pretended to be indifferent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
but the worm of desire burrowed deeper every
time Topeka was mentioned. The very fact that he was
uneducated, and, as the Democrats had said, unfit, made
him desire it the more. Criticism had aroused the spirit
of contest in him. Also he wanted Susan, now that she
had begun to plan for it, to have it. Nathan Hornby
knew that the woman he had married was his superior,
and loved her for it. Masculine jealousy he did not know.
He would have been sincerely glad to have had her elected
to the legislature of Kansas instead of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like Sue t&#8217; want t&#8217; take th&#8217; girl,&#8221; he meditated,
the next day in the cornfield. &#8220;She&#8217;ll see Katie in every
girl she sees for th&#8217; rest of &#8217;er days, I reckon. I wouldn&#8217;t
&#8217;a&#8217; had no show at Topeka, nohow, if she hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; made
Wallace feel good &#8217;bout that crazy thing he calls &#8217;is wife.
Curious how big things hinge on little ones. Now Sue
had no more idea o&#8217; gettin&#8217; a nomination t&#8217; th&#8217; legislature
for me than that hen she was foolin&#8217; with this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;
Later, he remembered the thing that had worried him
before the subject of Topeka came up. &#8220;Wonder what I
done that set that youngster t&#8217; lookin&#8217; at me so funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hornby had not set her heart on going to Topeka
foolishly, but she wanted to go and it entered into all her
plans. She did not tell the young girl of her plans at
once, but waited for her to make her place in Nathan&#8217;s
heart, as she was sure she would do. On that point the
girl succeeded surprisingly. Her knowledge of horses, of
harness, of farm subjects in general made good soil for
conversation with her host, and her love for the motherless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
colt called her to the barn and made special openings for
communications. Nathan called the colt, which was of
the feminine gender, Pat, because its upper lip was so long,
and that too the girl enjoyed, and entered into the joke
by softening the name to Patsie. They were good friends.
Having decided to befriend her, the man&#8217;s interest in her
increased. She was to be theirs. The sense of possession
grew with both husband and wife. Already they had cast
their lot with the child, and when at last they put the
question of the high school to her, the friendship was
firmly welded by the extravagance of its reception.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it! Think of it! Only think of it! I didn&#8217;t
know how it was going to come about, but I was sure I was
going to get it somehow!&#8221; the young girl cried, dancing
about the room excitedly. &#8220;Whenever I was afraid something
was going to keep me from it, I used to say, &#8216;I
will! I will! I will go to high school!&#8217; Oh, isn&#8217;t it too
lovely! Do you think my saying it made any difference?&#8221;
she asked eagerly; and the quaint couple, who were born
two generations in advance of the birth cry of New
Thought, laughed innocently and made no reply.</p>
<p>When the floodgates of surprise and emotion were
opened, and she began to talk of her hopes and fears, it
was but natural that she should speak of her struggles for
personal improvement, though this was instinctively done
when Mr. Hornby was absent.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, some of her points of information
were as helpful to Susan Hornby as they had been to her.
Mrs. Hornby knew the rules of good grammar, but many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
little observances of table manners had changed since her
youth. She read and was well informed on general topics
of the day, but her life for more than fifteen years had
been spent with Nathan and with the hired men who ate
at her table, and she had become careless of small things,
so that she listened with an amused smile, but with
real profit as well, to Lizzie&#8217;s confidences that &#8220;You
shouldn&#8217;t cross your knife and fork on your plate when
you are through eating, like the hired men, but lay them
side by side, neat and straight&#8221;; that &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t eat
with your knife, neither,&#8221; and that &#8220;To sip your coffee
out of your saucer with a noise like grasshoppers&#8217; wings
was just awful!&#8221; She, too, was brushing up to go to Topeka,
and while much in advance of her husband or any of her
associates in society matters, she had lived the life of the
farm, and to the end of her existence would be conscious
of the inequalities of her education. Of this she said
nothing to the child, but listened and remembered. Occasionally
she reminded the girl that they might not go to
Topeka, but even as she warned she was quickening the
subconscious mind to aid in recording any fact which
might be advantageous when she herself got there, and
her love for the child grew. The girl was part of the
scheme. In a week she had become one of the family.</p>
<p>At the end of the week Mr. Farnshaw did not appear;
farm matters had detained him, so that the opportunity
for a closer acquaintance with his daughter was permitted.
Under Mrs. Hornby the child blossomed naturally.
The old-fashioned secretary was the young girl&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
delight. Seeing her shaking in silent glee over &#8220;David
Copperfield&#8221; one night, and remembering her eager pursuit
of intellectual things, Mrs. Hornby remarked to her
husband, &#8220;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&#8221; The
world of to-day would add to Susan Hornby&#8217;s little speech,
&#8220;Not only as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,&#8221; but
&#8220;So shall he live, and do, and be surrounded.&#8221; This
simple daughter of the farm, the herds, and the homesteaded
hills of bleak and barren Kansas, where the educated
and intellectual of earth were as much foreigners
as the inhabitants of far off Russia or Hindustan, had by
her thought not only prepared herself for the life she
coveted, but had compelled the opportunity to enter upon
her travels therein. When Mr. Farnshaw arrived, Mrs.
Hornby was fortunate in the form of her request to take
his daughter with her, and it was arranged that if they
went to Topeka the child should be a member of their
household.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be just as good to her as if she were our own,&#8221;
she promised, and then added reflectively, &#8220;We&#8217;re going
to call her her full name too. Elizabeth was my mother&#8217;s
name. It&#8217;s so much prettier than Lizzie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under any other circumstances Mr. Farnshaw would
have seen symptoms of being &#8220;stuck-up&#8221; in the change of
name, but Elizabeth had been his mother&#8217;s name, and
although he had little recollection of his mother, and had
never heard her called by her given name, he had seen it
writ large on her tombstone, and, his eye having become
accustomed to the word, his ear fell naturally into line
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
with its pronunciation; besides, his daughter was to be a
school-teacher, and was to sign contracts like a man, and
must have a proper sort of name. She was to live in the
house of a member of the legislature, too, and already
called him and his wife &#8220;Uncle&#8221; and &#8220;Aunt.&#8221; Mr. Farnshaw
tasted pride and found it a sweet morsel.</p>
<p>Election day came the first week in November and
Nathan was successful. With the high school year in
view, they moved to Topeka the next week. It was as
if they were literally to educate their Katie. A slight
disappointment awaited them. Though they were ready
the young girl did not come immediately.</p>
<p>According to the dilatory methods of the Farnshaw
household, Elizabeth&mdash;she had been supported by her
father when the boys had shown an inclination to laugh
her out of the change of name&mdash;was three weeks later
yet in going. The eager girl urged at home that she would
be behind her classes if she went into school so late in the
term, but her parents, who knew nothing of school requirements,
refused to let her go till the corn was all
husked and everything snug for the winter, arguing that
so much stock had been lost the winter before that every
care must be taken of what was left. Tears at the prospect
of such a handicap made no impression, and it was
not till December that the child and her father set off in
the farm wagon for Topeka, two days distant. Railroad
fare was not to be considered, and two new dresses and a
new pair of shoes&mdash;not side-laces&mdash;were all the additions
to her wardrobe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Susan Hornby was much annoyed at the delay, but met
the young girl with open arms when she arrived.</p>
<p>She was less happy in accosting Mr. Farnshaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in this world did you keep her so late? Half the
year is gone!&#8221; was her luckless remark to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s doin&#8217; mighty well t&#8217; get t&#8217; come at all,&#8221; Mr.
Farnshaw replied, taking instant offence. &#8220;I&#8217;m th&#8217; only
man in our part of th&#8217; country that&#8217;s givin&#8217; &#8217;is childern
any show at th&#8217; high school at all, I can tell you. I knew
I wouldn&#8217;t get no thanks for it from th&#8217; beginnin&#8217;. That&#8217;s
th&#8217; way with things nowadays,&#8221; was his reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we all know you have needed her, and that
it&#8217;s hard to spare a child on the farm, but we were so anxious
to have her have all that could be got out of this
year,&#8221; Mrs. Hornby said, divided between a desire to
scold the man and a real disinclination to hurt any one.
So much valuable time had been lost. She saw that she
must be politic for Elizabeth&#8217;s sake, however, for the
child&#8217;s appearance told the experienced woman that she
must keep him in a good humour and inveigle him into
giving her a little money for clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just make the best of the time that is left, little
girl,&#8221; Mrs. Hornby said cheerfully, and in that only added
to the impression already made, for Mr. Farnshaw remembered
his daughter&#8217;s tears, and the feeling grew that
instead of being lauded for what he considered a great
sacrifice on his part, he was coming in for a blame wholly
unexpected, and that this woman was siding with the
girl and going to spoil her. People of the farm, more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
any other class, resent being blamed, and Josiah Farnshaw
was an extreme representative of his class. He had
come to Topeka delighted with himself because of the fine
opportunities he was giving his daughter, and here was
this woman at the first word finding fault because he had
not done better; it was no wonder that children were not
satisfied with anything a man could give them!</p>
<p>There was now no possibility of Elizabeth entering
school till after Christmas, and Aunt Susan turned her attention
to efforts to get the most out of the time they
would have to reorganize the poorly constructed dresses.
She was considerate of Mr. Farnshaw&#8217;s evident sensitiveness,
seeing also that he had no real comprehension of the
damage done by the delay, and made him comfortable
by urging him to stay on after he was really ready to go
home. So successful was she that he forgot for the time
he was in her presence that all was not in his favour, and
she was able to induce him to give all that he was able to
give toward the improvements she suggested in his
daughter&#8217;s wearing apparel. Elizabeth was surprised at
the ready response to demands made upon his purse, but
here again Mrs. Hornby left a sting, wholly unintended
and at the time not recognized by Mr. Farnshaw himself,
but remembered by him later and never forgotten after it
was once fixed firmly in his mind. Aunt Susan, concerned
for the entrance of the child into the company of those of
her own age, pointed out to her father the gayly dressed
girls of Elizabeth&#8217;s age, and suggested that a new coat
would be an absolute necessity. Mr. Farnshaw had given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Mrs. Hornby all the money he had with him except four
dollars, and his wife had given him a list of groceries to be
purchased in the city. It rather pleased him to use the
money toward his daughter&#8217;s adornment and it tickled
his pride as well to give his last cent toward her education.
Mrs. Hornby looked at the money he placed in her hand,
and hesitated visibly. Josiah Farnshaw stiffened at her
manner. Aunt Susan hated to ask for more, but this
would not buy the girl a coat that she could wear in Topeka!</p>
<p>&#8220;You are just as good as you can be about this, Mr.
Farnshaw, but&mdash;but a coat like the other girls have will
cost at least eight or ten dollars.&#8221; She felt his attitude.</p>
<p>The amount named took the man&#8217;s breath. He had
given all he had and yet this woman, whom he had begun
to like again, was not satisfied!</p>
<p>&#8220;A man can&#8217;t do no more&#8217;n he can, an&#8217; that&#8217;s th&#8217; last
red cent I&#8217;ve got,&#8221; he replied, humiliated at the necessity
of the confession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; Aunt Susan exclaimed, really so at
having forced the statement. She sat with her brows knit
in serious thought a moment, and a light began to break
in upon her. Elizabeth had to have that wrap somehow
and here was a way right before her. She remembered a
long cape she had noticed going down the street that very
morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can make it do,&#8221; she said hesitantly. She
was thinking out her plan and spoke slowly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just
make a cloak ourselves. We can do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>Josiah Farnshaw left the next day for home, in a good
humour with himself and his munificence, but on the way
home remembered Susan Hornby&#8217;s hesitancy and later
decision to make the cloak herself, and the worm of suspicion
began to gnaw again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that woman could make something that&#8217;d do,
what&#8217;d she ask for one of them expensive coats for?&#8221; he
asked himself. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s only th&#8217; girl that figures in
that deal! I ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but th&#8217; oats she feeds on nohow,&#8221;
he reflected, and having once given the thought
lodgment it grew and became the chief stone of the corner.</p>
<p>Our own comes to us, and Josiah Farnshaw had formed
the habit of that kind of thinking. He felt that he was
being robbed, and forgot that his daughter was being befriended,
and out of his trip to Topeka got only a sour
distaste for the woman he could clearly see was going to
encourage the child in extravagance. He had never spent
so much money on the entire family in a winter as he had
done on that girl, and yet it wasn&#8217;t enough. &#8220;He&#8217;d bet
he&#8217;d never give &#8217;er another year&#8217;s schoolin&#8217;. She&#8217;d come
home an&#8217; get a summer school&mdash;that&#8217;s what she&#8217;d do.
All folks thought about nowadays was clothes!&#8221;</p>
<p>To Elizabeth Farnshaw every day of that busy month
was full of unconscious growth. As soon as Mr. Farnshaw
was out of sight, Mrs. Hornby said to Elizabeth:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my child, I am going to take up the seams in
that basque.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked down at her &#8220;long basque&#8221; in dismay;
she had striven hard over that waist and had thought that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
it would do very well, though conscious that it had faults.
Her face flushed as she answered reluctantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The seam in the back isn&#8217;t quite straight, but&mdash;I
never made one like it before&mdash;and I thought it would
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it would, dear, but it can do better and we&#8217;ve got
plenty of time to fix it. You&#8217;ll feel ever so much better
about it when you see how the other girls are dressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Aunt Susan snipped and ripped and rebasted the
refractory seam, Elizabeth brought out her little stores of
finery to discuss their artistic features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; she said, opening a pasteboard box which held
her few ribbons. &#8220;I coaxed a long time for that, but I
got it.&#8221; She held up for Aunt Susan&#8217;s approval a new
Alsatian bow of pink ribbon. &#8220;I wanted the wide, but
they didn&#8217;t have it, so I got a lot of the narrow and hid
the joinings in the pleats. I think it&#8217;s pretty, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby looked at the bow critically, and then
seeing Elizabeth&#8217;s face cloud over with a suspicion that she
did not regard the treasure with favour, said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty&mdash;that is, it&#8217;s a pretty colour; but I was
looking to see about how many yards there was in it, for
the girls aren&#8217;t wearing Alsatian bows, as you call them,
this year. They seem to be wearing their hair mostly in
two plain braids. I&#8217;m glad of it, for you look ever so
much better with your hair done that way. We can rip
it up and press the ribbon. I&#8217;m awfully glad you&#8217;ve got
such a lot; It&#8217;ll make lovely bows for the braids.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>While Elizabeth ripped her bow to pieces Aunt Susan&#8217;s
tongue ran on with the subject nearest her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning I&#8217;m going to have you sit by that
window and watch the girls that go past about school
time. You&#8217;ll learn more this month doing that than you
would in school, I expect. It&#8217;s just as well you can&#8217;t
start till next term, since you didn&#8217;t get here at first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next term!&#8221; her new dresses with their long basques&mdash;long
basques were more talked of than any other
feature of dress that year, not by Elizabeth alone but all
womankind&mdash;had seemed so magnificent that she could
not think of it being necessary to take a whole month to
make them over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, not till after Christmas. You can&#8217;t start in at
the middle of a term in high school like you can in the
country. We&#8217;ll get you a wrap made before that time.
I told your father I couldn&#8217;t think of your going without
a coat of some sort. He didn&#8217;t feel that he could afford a
coat, so I&#8217;m going to get the cloth and you and I will make
you a circular this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A circular? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Susan explained the new kind of cape which came
down to the bottom of the dress and had a hood lined with
bright coloured silk and was puckered with rubber to make
it fit the face.</p>
<p>It took all day to finish the basque, and the next morning
Elizabeth watched the well-dressed city girls loiter
past, and was glad that she could have a month to get
ready to meet them in the schoolroom. She had never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
known anybody dressed so well for anything but a funeral,
or a party, or to go to church. They actually wore gloves
to school! Elizabeth looked at her brown hands and
decided that she would wear her mittens to bed till her
hands sweated themselves to a proper degree of whiteness,
and Susan Hornby let her look on, and weigh, and exclaim.
Thus was Elizabeth Farnshaw&#8217;s education begun.</p>
<p>The afternoon was spent selecting the goods for the new
cape, and wandering about the great stores and the streets;
a new pair of pretty gray gloves were obtained, and
for the first time Elizabeth heard the term &#8220;lisle thread&#8221;
used as against the common term of cotton for all things
not silk or woollen. The new cape was to have a wonderful
metal fastener called a clasp, and life ran like a silver
stream the next two days as they sewed on the new-fangled
garment.</p>
<p>Oh, father! could you have but seen truly, how great
would have been your joy!</p>
<p>Each day Elizabeth watched the boys and girls come
and go past Nathan Hornby&#8217;s house, and when the cape
was finished she and Aunt Susan went daily on shopping
expeditions. It was the most wonderful week of her
fifteen years, and was well rounded out by going to church
on Sunday and for the first time listening to a choir, and
seeing a window of softly coloured glass. She almost
wondered if she had been transported from the body to
the heaven of crowns and harps which her mother loved
to describe.</p>
<p>To heaven Elizabeth Farnshaw had gone in very truth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
but it was the heaven of adolescence and developing womanhood.
In the short time she had been observing the
comings and goings of the boys and girls of their neighbourhood
one young man had begun to stand out from the
rest. Elizabeth was nearly sixteen, and when she saw <i>him</i>
now in a pew a few seats ahead of her she made a little
movement of astonishment.</p>
<p>Aunt Susan caught the sound of the indrawn breath
and looked around inquiringly, but Elizabeth, with eyes
modestly down, studied her gray-gloved hands and seemed
unaware of her scrutiny. Happiness had been Elizabeth
Farnshaw&#8217;s daily portion for weeks, but this was different.
Here was happiness of another sort, with other qualities,
composed of more compelling elements. The gamut of
bliss had not all been run. Elizabeth had progressed from
Arcadia to Paradise and was invoicing her emotions. She
never shied around a subject, but looked all things in the
face; and she found this delightfully surprising world of
emotions as entrancing as the external one of mellow light,
music, good clothes, and educational prospects. The rest
of the hour was a blissful dream, in which the only thought
was a wish for Luther and his stunted pony and the freedom
of grassy slopes where she could pour out her newfound
joy. With each new event of this life the loss of
Luther was accentuated.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby and his wife had no acquaintances in
Topeka. They left the church as soon as the service was
over. The young girl went with them, conscious that <i>he</i>
was behind her, glad that her new cape was finished,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
wondering if <i>he</i> noticed it, eager to be seen yet wanting to
hide, and foolishly aglow and wishing devoutly that she
had eyes in the back of her head. Henceforth Elizabeth
lived in the thought of seeing <i>him</i>. She dubbed him
&#8220;The Unknown,&#8221; and if she looked out of the window at
home, it was in the hope of seeing him pass; on the way to
school she was alert and watchful for a glimpse of him in
the distance; if she went to church it was to look for him
as soon as seated, though he was rarely there. If she saw
him in the morning her day was made glad; if she failed to
see him she looked forward with anticipation to the next
day.</p>
<p>The winter spent itself. January passed, and February.
The glad days ran on in kaleidoscopic readjustment
of joy, work, wonder, and unfoldment, as far as
Elizabeth&#8217;s own life was concerned. After the manner of
youth, her own affairs absorbed her. In fact the young
girl was so filled with the delights of her own little world
that it was only gradually that she began to understand
that the life in Topeka was not as fortunate with the dear
couple who had shared with her their home. The first
signs of trouble were made manifest to her by the increasing
tenderness with which Susan Hornby hovered around
her mate, and her evident and growing solicitude.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was startled when she did at last comprehend
the gloom and anxiety about her. The manner of the
pair prevented questions, but, as she watched covertly,
Aunt Susan&#8217;s distress was transferred to her. Elizabeth
was not curious, but she was intensely sympathetic, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
from disinterested motives she became keenly observant
of all that took place about her. No opportunity to help
offered. With a sharp realization that her best friends
were in trouble, she was obliged to conceal any trace of
that knowledge. Nathan and his wife talked apart and
in low tones, avoiding the young girl&#8217;s presence, and were
evidently puzzled and uneasy. It was Elizabeth&#8217;s way
to make the troubles of those about her her own. Longing
to help, it was impossible to be indifferent. Gradually
she got bits of indirect light upon the subject. From
little things dropped accidentally, and often from explanations
which circumstances forced upon them, Elizabeth
learned that money was scarce. This came as a shock,
and with all the hurt and heartsick worry which the mention
of finances always brought to the girl. Why must
people have money? she asked herself daily. And mixed
with dreams of &#8220;The Unknown&#8221; came speculations as to
the part which money played in the game of life, and the
bondage of men to it, and a longing to be free from its
withering grasp. In her childish mind the matter of freedom
became slightly mixed and she dreamed dreams of
being free by owning unlimited amounts of it, and she
coveted marvellous bank accounts, acquired in some
mystical way, with which the woes of humanity could be
relieved by giving. Along with this new idea of dispensing
charity grew a desire to know why the crop of cash was
short in Nathan Hornby&#8217;s home. In her innocent way
she led up to the subject of expenses in general, but Aunt
Susan kept family affairs strictly in the family and vouchsafed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
no explanations, unaware that the example she set
in that way was to bear strange and unexpected fruit.
But though Elizabeth carried the reflex of the anxiety of
those about her, she was scarcely sixteen, and youth and
joy and life claimed her attention and the affairs of her
stage in life&#8217;s span crowded out the affairs of others.</p>
<p>These were days of transition. The child was becoming
a woman. The love which was flowing out of her heart
like a spring freshet toward one who, because she saw
him less often was the more often in her thoughts, was
making Elizabeth Farnshaw more observant of those who
professed love. Desiring mutual relations, she became
sensitive to the communications of those about her who
had to do with mutual relations.</p>
<p>Elizabeth saw that the more trouble clouded the brow
of Nathan Hornby the cheerier and closer Aunt Susan
drew to him. There was none of the quarrels here to
which Elizabeth had become accustomed when things
went wrong at home. The contrast between her father&#8217;s
and mother&#8217;s daily life and that of Nathan and Susan
Hornby in times of trouble was the subject of constant
thought. Nathan and Susan Hornby were to be guide-posts
along the highway of Elizabeth Farnshaw&#8217;s domestic
affairs. Love pointed her thoughts toward marriage, and
here was a worthy model after which to build. Her natural
affection and gratitude were enhanced by the fact
that this couple with whom she lived, and who were otherwise
very dear to her, were the immediate example of all
that was noble in the world of her present dreams.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>The fact that the harmony between Aunt Susan and
her mate was of stern stuff and not matured solely upon
success and pleasure added to the strength of that example.
Elizabeth had not been taken into the confidence of
either; their private affairs were kept screened from the
gaze of any but themselves. By a word dropped here and
there, however, she learned that Nathan had speculated
and lost much money; also that he had favoured measures
advanced by butter-tongued lobbyists, and that he had
lost the good-will of many of his constituents.</p>
<p>While Elizabeth watched the tender association of
Nathan Hornby and his wife and found such glowing
tribute in her heart toward the life they lived together, a
tragedy, in spite of the support and affection lavished
by a faithful wife, was to leave the sunny, cordial man
a broken, half-suspicious one.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby was to learn that legislative assemblies
were death-traps to those whom providence had failed to
coach in diplomacy and judgment, that legislation was a
game at which none but gamesters might successfully play,
a devouring flame singeing the wings of all who failed to
distinguish between the light of a common candle and
that of a real sun, that it was a nightmare to most, and
ticklish business for all. Unable to distinguish between
the good and the bad intentions of those who advocated
the passage of bills, convinced long before the
end of the legislative session that a bill looking innocent
and direct in its wording might be evil and indirect
in its outworking, Nathan became more and more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
confused and less and less able to withstand the attacks
made upon him.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby was a leaden figure in the legislative
assembly. He was honest, but slow of wit, and apt to
become passive if pushed beyond his power to understand.
This man who could throw the earth up to a hill of corn
with skill and precision, who could build a haystack which
would turn the rains and snows of winter, and break a colt
to the harness without breaking its spirit, who had handled
successfully the problems to which he had been trained,
was not able to throw arguments up to the legislative hill
or protect his reputation against the floods of criticism and
accusation to which his actions were subjected either here
in the Capitol or at home among his constituents. His
spirit was broken: he recognized that he was totally unfit
for the position into which fortune had thrust him. Nathan
sat back in his chair, in the House, with few books and
papers on the desk before him, and these unopened, his
manner, like his wrinkled boots, indicative of the farm,
his whole attitude that of the unsophisticated. He listened
to the speeches made around him, but had no ideas
to express. He was a pathetic figure. Only the accidents
of Grasshopper Year, when legislative timber was scarce,
could have placed him in such a position. His tough,
shaven cheeks grew thinner day by day as he pulled at the
brush of grizzled chin-whiskers and tried to understand
what went on before him.</p>
<p>During those days Susan was both his refuge and the
cross of his crucifixion. The deeper his difficulties became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the more he turned to her for help, certain not only that
she understood better than he the measures about which
his colleagues argued, but that she understood him and his
failures, as well as his needs. It was because Susan understood
that the cross was so heavy. If his wife had been a
dull woman, if she had been a woman without ambitions of
her own, if she could have been hoaxed into thinking him
the equal of his associates, it would have been easier; but
Nathan was aware that Susan Hornby knew to the finest
detail the nature of his failure as well as she understood
and loved the best in him. During those gloomy days
the man marvelled at the gentleness of her solicitations
for his cheering and encouragement, not realizing that
woman is by nature faithful where man is appreciative of
her devotion. Appreciation! that had been the keynote
of Nathan Hornby&#8217;s attitude toward his wife. Susan
had always known what she ought to do, what she wanted
to do, and what it was best for her to do, and in all matters
where her individual affairs were concerned Nathan had
never interposed coercion nor advice. If Susan made
mistakes, her husband knew that they were the mistakes
of the head and not of the heart, and left her to correct
them in her own way.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby had always been free, and now the walls
of love and trust which Nathan Hornby had builded about
their home for nearly twenty years were to be a flawless
rampart behind which he could take refuge from foes without
and receive help from within. At Nathan&#8217;s request
his wife came day after day and listened to the discussions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
toward the end of the session. Nathan sat before her
dumb, but she was the anchor to his drifting soul as the
political landslide took the ground out from under his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wisht I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; taken you in on this thing sooner,&#8221;
he said on one occasion, and remembered those first weeks
when he had felt self-sufficient, and had made false moves
at the State House, and had also let himself be inveigled into
buying &#8220;a few margins.&#8221; That was the bitterest drop in
his cup. Wheat had dropped steadily from the very day he
had begun buying. A steady decline in prices was unthinkable,
and it was not till their land was endangered
that the trusting man began to take alarm, and even then
he let the speculators who profited by the sales induce him
to make one more wild investment to save that which he
had already lost.</p>
<p>His certainty that his neighbors would take revenge
upon <i>him</i> for political differences by sly prods
regarding speculation was of slight importance, but Susan
was to be humiliated before them!&mdash;Susan, who had tried
to help him to see the dangers&mdash;Susan, who did not complain
when she was called upon to sign the deeds to the
land she had helped to win from the Indians and the
wilderness of uncultivated things. Nathan remembered
on that bitter day that but for her adventurous spirit he
would have been working at day&#8217;s wages in old Indiana,
instead of having a home and being an active member of
his community and a member of the legislature of his state,
with opportunities to prove himself a man in the world of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
men. He had failed, and his failure reacted upon her.
It was not the loss of money and political prestige alone
which bit. Another phase of their life in Topeka added
its humiliation. Nathan had wanted his wife to share
his political honours and had found himself ignorant of
every means by which these things could be brought to her.
He had heard of gay winters at the Capital, but they lived
apart from it all. The house in which he had placed her
was attractive and on a good street, but the men whom he
met at the State House soon saw that nothing was to be
gained through knowing Nathan Hornby, and failed to ask
their wives to call upon his wife.</p>
<p>Disaster is in exact ratio to our valuation of things.
Although Nathan Hornby had lost three fourths of his
land, his reputation as a business man and politician, and
his faith in men, he still had left the one essential gift
which should have helped him to win again all that which he
had lost. Susan Hornby, like Ruth of old, abandoned all
else and abode with her husband in love, cheering him at
each problematical step, and saying as they returned from
the notary&#8217;s office after signing away their land to a stranger:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Nate, there are only two of us,&#8221; and for
the first time since their little daughter had been taken
from them, he had replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, only two, thank God!&#8221; and had kissed awkwardly
the hand laid over his mouth, and Susan had seen the
glitter of a tear on his faded lashes, the first in many years.</p>
<p>Susan knew that Nathan would never forget the failures
of that year, but she also knew that the comfort of accustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
activities would help to fill his mind and keep his
thoughts from sore introspection. Here in Topeka there
was nothing to do but cogitate and reflect. It was therefore
a relief to her when Elizabeth received a letter from
her mother summoning her home to teach a spring term
of school. While at any other time she would have been
filled with indignation at the recall of Elizabeth just as
she was beginning to get settled to her new work, Susan
Hornby felt that Elizabeth needed education less at this
point than Nathan needed the busy seeding season to
occupy his troubled thoughts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>REFORMS NOT EASY TO DISCUSS</h3>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth kept her tears and regrets to herself.
She cried them out on her pillow that night, all the
disappointments and handicaps of that wonderful
year of experience and aspiration, but as she cried she
planned the arrangements of her going.</p>
<p>The letter was received on Thursday night; Elizabeth
decided that she would go for her books the next day, and
say her farewells to desk, recitation room, and the halls
that had been dear to her. When Elizabeth was called
to the blackboard that afternoon to explain a problem in
algebra, the board, the pointer, the very chalk in her
fingers cried aloud their unity with her life and thought,
and she sat down when it was over with a great throbbing
in her throat and ears, and a sense of overwhelming disaster.</p>
<p>As Elizabeth carried her books home under her arm,
bulging out one side of her circular like an unevenly inflated
pudding-bag, the throbbing continued, and she
turned into the less frequented streets with the certainty
that she was going to disgrace herself with tears shed
publicly. It had been a trying day, and in spite of all
efforts her emotions broke loose before she could gain the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
shelter of home. Hurrying blindly to get the last block
covered, she nearly dropped her books as she turned the
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Unknown&#8221; was coming toward her!</p>
<p>Her startled glance of recognition was so unexpectedly
open that he thought that he had probably met her. He
looked puzzled, but lifted his hat as she hurried past him,
wiping the tears from her face with her free hand.</p>
<p>A boy called from across the street an instant later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Hugh, I&#8217;m coming over for some help on that
chem. ex. to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; came the answer from &#8220;The Unknown,&#8221; and
mixed with Elizabeth&#8217;s mortifying confusion was a quick
thrill at knowing his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>No opportunity had ever come to meet him or to find out
what his name might be. Elizabeth was conscious that her
life on the farm had made of her an impossible mate for
this young man who, even among the young men of the
city, was set apart by a peculiar grace and culture. She
remembered the hat which had not merely been lifted
from the head, but had been carried below the chin as he
bowed distantly, and also the well-bred curiosity of his
look. The rest of the leave-taking was made easier by
having met him, and received his bow, and acquired the
glorious, mystical knowledge of his name.</p>
<p>To round out the experiences of the winter, fate decreed
that Mr. Farnshaw could not come for her, and the glitter
of the inside of a railway coach, with its brass lamps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
plush seats, and polished woods, was added to her experimental
knowledge. Luther was somehow connected
in her mind with the day&#8217;s experiences and she wished
devoutly that she could talk to him about the disappointment
of leaving her school before the end of the term, and
of this journey home on the train, and of Hugh. Yes,
Elizabeth would have told Luther even of Hugh. Luther
Hansen was to Elizabeth Farnshaw unchanged and unchangeable.
The transformations of her own life did not
call for any such transformations in him. He was Luther.
It had been his mental processes which had won and now
sustained her attachment for him. Their two minds had
worked together as one mind while they had struggled
with the innocent problems of their childhood days, and
Elizabeth still felt incomplete without him. She had
been less conscious of Luther&#8217;s absence the first year than
at any time since his going away, but in Topeka, and now
that she was approaching the scene of their association
together, Elizabeth wanted him with a depth of homesickness
she had never felt before. It was hard to go back to
the old battleground and not find him there. The prospects
in store for her at home made her shrink. Elizabeth fell
to wondering if any improvement in that home were possible.
She had had them quite cheerfully in mind all
winter, but now that the distance between her home and
herself lessened rapidly a feeling of inadequacy came upon
her, and the glitter of the wonderful coach in which she
was riding was forgotten. Could she help? The only
thing that was very clear to her was that much patience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
would be necessary. At Uncle Nathan&#8217;s they had been
gentle and loving and tolerant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I make them see it&mdash;and see how?&#8221; she asked
herself so many times that the wheels beneath her took
up the refrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentle and loving and tolerant&mdash;gentle and loving
and tolerant&mdash;gentle and loving and tolerant,&#8221; they
sang for miles as she sat with her young brow puckered
into a deep frown.</p>
<p>The realities of life were thrust into the foreground the
moment Elizabeth arrived, and for new reasons she missed
Luther. Mr. Farnshaw resented the new circular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that th&#8217; damned fool kind of coat she was talkin&#8217;
about?&#8221; he inquired as his daughter alighted from the
farm wagon at the kitchen door that afternoon. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t got no warmth,&#8221; he added scornfully. &#8220;Th&#8217; ain&#8217;
nothin&#8217; to it but looks, an&#8217; not much of that. What &#8217;d y&#8217;
you do with th&#8217; coat you had?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old heartsickening contention had begun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see that you wear it and don&#8217;t go makin&#8217; a
fool out of yourself around here. I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; kept my money
if I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; knowed it was goin&#8217; t&#8217; be put into a thing that&#8217;d
swell up in th&#8217; wind like a balloon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw saw the look that swept over Elizabeth&#8217;s
face and instinctively ranged herself on the side of the
young girl. She saw with a woman&#8217;s eyes the style in
the garment and its importance in her daughter&#8217;s appearance.
When Elizabeth took it off her mother took it to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the bedroom to put it away, remarking in a whisper that
it made her look quite like a school-teacher ought to look.
She was secretly glad that her daughter had it, since it was
already paid for and she did not have to make it. It
would be the most observed wrap in the schoolhouse the
next Sunday if she could only persuade Elizabeth to go to
meeting. The metal clasp had virtues all its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s ever so much more stuck-up than if it had
buttons,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>The undertone rasped on Elizabeth&#8217;s nerves. Aunt
Susan never differed with Uncle Nate in undertones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get supper, ma,&#8221; she said, to shake herself from
threatened despondency.</p>
<p>But though Elizabeth bustled energetically about the
getting of that meal, the eating of it was not a very great
success. Mr. Farnshaw discoursed upon the senselessness
of prevailing styles, with the new cape plainly in
mind, and Mrs. Farnshaw nudged her daughter&#8217;s knee
under the table whenever Elizabeth seemed inclined to
defensive retorts.</p>
<p>When Mr. Farnshaw had taken the milk pails on his
arm and repaired to the corral, however, Mrs. Farnshaw
turned from a belated churning and administered the
caution in words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever say anything back to your pa, Lizzie; he
gets worse and worse all th&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth considered the subject for some minutes.
The wear and tear of the discords of her mother&#8217;s life
she knew were far more responsible for her mother&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
broken health than anything she did in the way of hard
work. It seemed a good time to begin the reforms upon
which her heart was set.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma, I&#8217;ve been thinking about you a good deal
this winter,&#8221; she began slowly. &#8220;Something is wrong
with us all.&#8221; The girl thought again for a moment.
Her mother watched her with sharp attention and waited.
Reforms were not easy to discuss with her mother; they
were very different, Elizabeth and her mother. Elizabeth
hardly dared express her longing to reorganize their
home. If only she could effect a reformation! Her
heart had been set on it all winter. She knew now how
people <i>could</i> live if only they understood how to do it.
Her help here was needed. When she began to speak
again it was very slowly, and with a careful consideration
of the words she was using.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought all of us to be different. We go along day
after day hating our work, scolding and fretting at each
other, and never really happy, any of us, and I&#8217;ve been
wondering why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother eyed her closely. Something of the girl&#8217;s
mood stirred a responsive chord.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of it too,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t never
tell why it is though, unless&#8221;&mdash;she spoke slowly and Elizabeth
was encouraged&mdash;&#8220;unless it&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t
never belong to ourselves. Now your pa wants t&#8217; run
th&#8217; house, an&#8217; th&#8217; farm, an&#8217; you children, an&#8217; me, an&#8217;
everything, an&#8217; I&#8217;m so tired, an&#8217; never have any help, that
anybody&#8217;d be cross. Nobody ever pities me, though.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Here, take this dasher an&#8217; finish this here churnin&#8217; for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth took the dasher into her own hand and stood
looking down meditatively at the cream gathered about
the hole in the churn lid. The first sentence of her
mother&#8217;s remark struck her attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t folks belong to themselves?&#8221; she asked,
letting the dasher rest while she churned mental problems
of greater moment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw looked up quickly. &#8220;Well, if you think
you can marry an&#8217; belong t&#8217; yourself, just you try it,&#8221; she
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, ma, if a man loved a woman couldn&#8217;t she get him
to leave her free? Now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw cut her short. &#8220;Love! Men don&#8217;t
know how to spell th&#8217; word. They get a woman, an&#8217;
after she&#8217;s got children they know she can&#8217;t help herself.
She&#8217;s got t&#8217; stick to it &#8217;cause she can&#8217;t raise &#8217;em alone an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;
it don&#8217;t make no difference whether he takes care
of &#8217;em or not&mdash;&#8221; Words failed the exasperated woman.</p>
<p>Elizabeth studied her mother with a new interest. She
began to apply her mother&#8217;s words to her own case. She
knew that her mother had wanted her services this spring
as much as her father, and remembered the letter calling
her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that don&#8217;t cover your case, ma. You love pa
more than you do us children; you know you do, and we
know that you do too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw usually denied the most obvious thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
if her protective instincts prompted her to do so, but her
daughter had hit the bull&#8217;s-eye so exactly that for the
moment she had no defence ready. Elizabeth was encouraged
by her mother&#8217;s silence. Mrs. Farnshaw talked
so much that it was not easy to get her attention. The
young girl, glowing with the discoveries made in Aunt
Susan&#8217;s home, desired to get at the bottom of the causes
of inharmony in her own and to reorganize it on a better
basis. It looked as if she was to be granted a hearing
upon her schemes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about him running over <i>us</i> so much,&#8221; she
said diplomatically, &#8220;but you let him run over you in the
same way. Now isn&#8217;t there some way to come at him
and get him to see it. When we&#8217;re alone you talk about
him domineering over you, but when he&#8217;s here you let
him say anything he wants to and you never try to help
yourself. Why don&#8217;t you strike out on a new tack and
say you won&#8217;t do it when he makes unreasonable demands?
Why don&#8217;t you reason with him good-naturedly,
if you think that&#8217;s better, without crying, I mean, and
then if he won&#8217;t listen at all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Lizzie,&#8221; the mother interposed slowly.
&#8220;I sometimes think I will an&#8217; then when he&#8217;s here something
won&#8217;t let me. It ain&#8217;t what he says to you; it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;something
he does to you when he looks at you.
I&#8217;m as weak as water when he looks at me. I don&#8217;t know
why. I guess it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve always give up&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;I
can&#8217;t tell why. A woman does just like a horse&mdash;there&#8217;s
more&#8217;n one kind of whippin&#8217; a man can give&mdash;an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
she gets scared&mdash;an&#8217; minds. A man begins right from
th&#8217; first t&#8217; tell her what to do an&#8217; she loves &#8217;im and wants
t&#8217; please &#8217;im, an&#8217; before long she don&#8217;t have her way no
more&#8217;n a nigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the truth of the statement came within the
grasp of the daughter, who was looking across the idle
churn with her mind fixed in singleness of purpose upon
remedies, and yet she felt that there was some other element
in the matter not yet accounted for. The hopeless
tone of the older woman, however, goaded her young spirit
into forgetting the caution necessary to dealing with the
subject. Her blood fired with resentment that one life
should be so crushed by another. It was her mother
whose shoulders drooped with a burden too heavy for her
to throw off.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re sure of that, why don&#8217;t you leave him? We
children are old enough to support ourselves and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had overshot the mark. Her mother was of
another generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, ma,&#8221; the girl protested quickly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
say leave him if you can find any way of settling
matters. Can&#8217;t you have a talk with him&mdash;and get
him to let you alone if you are willing to do the very
best you can? That&#8217;s the best way. Have you tried
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No I hain&#8217;t,&#8221; the mother replied shortly; &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t
do no good. But if my talkin&#8217; t&#8217; you is goin&#8217; t&#8217; make you
say such things, I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;t&#8217; talk t&#8217; you no more. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
folks is married they&#8217;re married, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t believe in
partin&#8217;, nor talk of partin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think maybe you are right, but if you and pa
are going to live together you ought to try and have it out,
and be a help to each other instead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She broke off
and thought a moment, &#8220;Now Aunt Susan and Uncle
Nate&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop right there!&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw cried, afire with
jealousy. &#8220;That woman&#8217;s brought more trouble into this
house a&#8217;ready than She&#8217;ll ever take out. Your pa&#8217;s been
rantin&#8217; about her all winter an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; he said you&#8217;d be
pokin&#8217; her ways into our faces th&#8217; very day you got home.
I &#8217;spect she&#8217;s th&#8217; one that got it into your head to talk of
partin&#8217;, most likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now, ma, don&#8217;t go on like that. You don&#8217;t know
about Aunt Susan. She&#8217;s the last person in the world to
ever suggest such a thing. That&#8217;s just what I started out
to say&mdash;they never have a word about anything. It&#8217;s
the loveliest home to live in, and I was just thinking that
they must have found&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I didn&#8217;t want t&#8217; hear nothin&#8217; more about them
folks, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw cried, caught on the
other horn of the argument and even more deeply offended
than before. &#8220;She&#8217;ll most likely get all your love just
like she got all your father&#8217;s money last winter. You
needn&#8217;t mention her here no more. Th&#8217; school directors &#8217;ll
be over to see you about fillin&#8217; out that term, to-night,&#8221;
Mrs. Farnshaw ended shortly, and turned the subject of
conversation to other channels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me? To fill out the term?&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed in
surprise. &#8220;What&#8217;s gone wrong with the school here? I
don&#8217;t want a piece of a term, and I don&#8217;t want, ever, to
teach in this district where I&#8217;ve gone to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to,&#8221; was the brief reply. &#8220;Your pa
an&#8217; me told &#8217;em you&#8217;d take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how does it happen that the school is without a
teacher?&#8221; Elizabeth asked with curiosity, ignoring the
curt disposal of her services. She was accustomed to the
peremptory measures of her parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake Ransom run him out. He just piked off after
he got his money order cashed last Saturday mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you expect me to take a school that&#8217;s all upside
down from that kind of handling&mdash;and me without any
experience?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take it an&#8217; You&#8217;ll do your best, an&#8217; we won&#8217;t
hear no more about it. Here, ma, tie up this finger,&#8221;
Mr. Farnshaw said. He had just come in from the barn
in time to hear his daughter&#8217;s objections.</p>
<p>Later in the evening the directors came. Family pressure
was strong, and with reluctance Elizabeth accepted
the month yet to be taught. It would help with the interest,
and that interest clouded the family sky to the
horizon on every side now. Elizabeth was divided between
a fear of inability to manage a demoralized school
and the desire to add twenty-five dollars to the family
revenue. In anticipation she saw the unruly boys supported
and encouraged in insubordination by such as
Sadie Crane, who was jealously ready to resent her&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
former playmate&mdash;in the rôle of authority. And to put
herself right with the governing board Elizabeth told the
new director&mdash;Sadie&#8217;s own father&mdash;her fears on that score.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have played with me and we have had the sort
of quarrels all children have, Mr. Crane, and I may not
be able to manage them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lon Crane was ignorant and uncouth, but big of heart,
and the openness of the discussion pleased him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You jest take that school, young lady, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll see that
my end of th&#8217; thing&#8217;s kep&#8217; up. I&#8217;ll come over there an
thrash every mother&#8217;s son of &#8217;em if I have t&#8217;. I&#8217;d kind
o&#8217; like t&#8217; lick a few of &#8217;em anyhow, an&#8217; if my young ones
give any trouble, you jes&#8217; stop in on your way home an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll see that it don&#8217;t never happen ag&#8217;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half the battle was won; she let him hold her hand a
moment at leave-taking while he reinforced his remarks
by many repetitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, Sis,&#8221; he repeated as he backed out of
the door; &#8220;you needn&#8217;t be afraid; this here school board&#8217;s
at your back. We know it&#8217;s a bad school, but, by ginger!
we&#8217;ll see that you&#8217;re stood by. You jes&#8217; let me know if
that there Jake Ransom tries any more monkeyshines and
I&#8217;ll tan his hide till It&#8217;ll be good for shoe leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>It occurred to Elizabeth that every word they were
saying would be carried to the boy long before Monday
morning and that a bad matter might from the very goodness
of the teller&#8217;s intentions be made worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old did you say the Ransom boy was?&#8221; she asked
with concern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen&mdash;and a stinker if there ever was one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think maybe I&#8217;ll have a show. I thought he
was older than that,&#8221; she said diplomatically. &#8220;Now may
I ask that what we have said be kept quiet? I would
rather like to have a fair show with him&mdash;and I&#8217;ll admit
I&#8217;d like to be on good terms. Promise me that what we
have said may be a secret even from your own family till
after Monday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth went forward and spoke confidentially. The
man liked her even better than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, by jing!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217;
t&#8217; know soon&#8217;s ever I get home what we done about it, an&#8217;
fur once they&#8217;ll suck their thumbs. Look out fur that
boy, though; he&#8217;s a black sheep that lives around in any
flock; ain&#8217;t got no home. I&#8217;ll help if I&#8217;m needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth listened closely to all that she heard her
brothers say about Jake Ransom, trying to form some
estimate of his character, and soon came to the conclusion
that whatever else the boy might be, he was at least not
to be classed as a sneak. In fact, Jake seemed to have
rather a surprising faculty for announcing his policies before
he began action.</p>
<p>When school opened Monday morning the bully was
easily recognizable. Elizabeth had gone through all the
stages of fright, of distaste for the job, and lastly of set
determination to show this district that she could take
that boy and not only conquer him but become friends
with him. Instead of being nervous about the coming
encounter, however, Elizabeth grew more steady and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
self-reliant as she felt his eyes upon her, and actually became
interested in the small affairs preceding the ringing
of the bell, and forgot him altogether till it was time to call
the roll.</p>
<p>Jacob Ransom&#8217;s name came last on the list. A titter
ran around the room when it was called. The tone of
reply was louder than the rest and defiant of manner.
Elizabeth looked around the room with frank inquiry and
the titter died down. She let her gaze wander quietly
and naturally down the aisle to the seat of the bully and
was surprised to find that she liked the boy.</p>
<p>Closing the roll book and following an instinct rather
than a formulated plan, Elizabeth walked slowly down the
room to his desk. A faint giggle behind her spoke of the
hushed expectations of trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hear any more laughing in this room, I shall inquire
into the matter,&#8221; she said sternly, facing about beside
Jake&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The instant response to that remark gave her confidence
in her own powers. It was the first time she had ever
used the tone of authority and she instinctively recognized
that the quality of her personality in that position was
good. Both she and Jake Ransom were on trial in that
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are the &#8216;Jake&#8217; I have heard about?&#8221; she said,
looking him frankly in the face and letting him see that
she was measuring him openly. &#8220;Is your name Jake or
Jacob?&#8221; she asked, as if it were an important matter to
get settled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call me Jacob,&#8221; the boy snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I like the nickname better myself,&#8221; Elizabeth
replied easily. Her good fairy beckoned her on. &#8220;These
children are all laughing because they think we are going
to pull each other&#8217;s hair presently. We will show them
at least that we are a lady and a gentleman, I trust. Let
me see your books.&#8221; She looked at him with such
straightforward sincerity that the boy returned the look
in the same spirit.</p>
<p>The books were produced in surprise; this was walking
into the middle of the ring and bidding for an <i>open</i> fight,
if fight they must. The boy loved a square deal. Jake
Ransom&#8217;s sting had been drawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in advance of the rest of the school. Are
you preparing for the high school?&#8221; Elizabeth asked,
emphasizing her surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, no!&#8221; the boy blurted out.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked through the book in her hand slowly
before she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you? I was only about as far along as
this in arithmetic last year. Some one said you were
ready for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I kin do &#8217;rithmetic all right, but I ain&#8217;t no good
in nothin&#8217; else&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t I look fine teachin&#8217;
school?&#8221; Jake Ransom exclaimed, but the bully melted
out of him by way of the fact that she had heard good
reports of him. He would not smoke this level-eyed girl
out of the schoolhouse, nor sprinkle the floor with cayenne,
as was the usual proceeding of the country bumpkin who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
failed to admire his teacher. Jake Ransom was not really
a bully; he was a shy boy who had been domineered over
by a young popinjay of a teacher who had never taught
school before and who had himself many lessons to learn
in life&#8217;s school. The boy brought out his slate, spit on its
grimy surface and wiped it with his sleeve. One of the
buttons on his cuff squeaked as he wiped it across, and
the children had something tangible to laugh at. Elizabeth
was wise enough to take no notice of that laugh.</p>
<p>Some one has said that experience is not as to duration
but as to intensity, and it was Elizabeth&#8217;s fate to live at
great pressure in every important stage of her life. But
for the fact that she had made a friend of Jake Ransom
that month&#8217;s events would have had a different story.
Sadie Crane took exceptions to every move made and
every mandate issued from the teacher&#8217;s desk. The spirit
of insubordination to which the entire school had been
subjected that winter made good soil for Sadie&#8217;s tares.
For the most part the dissatisfaction was a subtle thing,
an undercurrent of which Elizabeth was aware, but upon
which she could lay no finger of rebuke, but at times it
was more traceable, and then, to the young teacher&#8217;s
surprise, Jake Ransom had ways of dealing with the
offenders outside of school hours. Sadie&#8217;s tongue was
sharp and she was accustomed to a wholesome attitude
of fear among the scholars, but her first thrusts at Jake
had aroused a demon of which she had little dreamed.
Jake had no foolish pride and would admit his faults so
guilelessly that her satire fell to the ground. He was an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
entirely new sort to the spiteful child. The terrible advantage
the person who will admit his faults cheerfully has
over the one who has pride and evades was never more
manifest. Jake Ransom pointed out to a credulous following
the causes of Sadie&#8217;s disaffection, and left the
envious child in such a state of futile rage that she was
ready to burst with her ill-directed fury. In the end the
month&#8217;s work had to be granted the tribute of success,
and the term closed with a distinct triumph for Elizabeth
and the experience of a whole year&#8217;s trial crowded into
four short weeks.</p>
<p>At home things were not so fortunate. The young girl
had come back from Topeka with higher ideals of home
life, of personal conduct, and of good manners than she
had ever had before. It was so good to have something
better, and Elizabeth hungered to pass along the transforming
things she had found; but when she tried to give
the boys gentle hints about correct ways of eating she was
greeted with guffaws and sarcastic chuckles about handling
soup with a fork. Mrs. Farnshaw saw nothing but
Susan Hornby&#8217;s interference, Mr. Farnshaw told her to
attend to her own affairs until her help was desired, and
when the child was rebuffed and unable to hide her disappointment
and retired within herself, both parents
resented the evident and growing difference between her
and themselves.</p>
<p>It was to escape from a home which was unendurable
that Elizabeth flat-footedly, and for the first time, refused
to accede to her parents&#8217; authority. When the matter of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
a spring term of school came up for discussion she refused
to teach the home school again, though Mr. Crane had
been so pleased with her work that he had offered it to
her. When asked if Jake Ransom was the objection she
indignantly asserted to the contrary.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the best pupil I had,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t
want to teach at home, and I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; and that was
all she would say. She secured a school ten miles north
of her home; ten miles had been the nearest point which
she would consider.</p>
<p>The interest was at last paid, but when the summer
groceries were paid for there was no money left with which
to go back to Topeka, and it was necessary to teach a
winter school. Elizabeth went to work anew to collect
funds for another year&#8217;s schooling. Mr. Farnshaw sold
himself short of corn in the fall, however, and the young
girl was expected to make up the deficit. In the spring
the interest was to be paid again, and so at the end of a
year and a half the situation was unchanged. The next
year a threshing machine was added to the family assets,
and again the cry of &#8220;help&#8221; went up, again Elizabeth&#8217;s
plans were sacrificed. The next year the interest was
doubled, and for four years Elizabeth Farnshaw worked
against insurmountable odds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A CULTURED MAN</h3>
</div>

<p>When no remonstrance of hers availed to prevent
the constant increase of expenses, Elizabeth saw
that her assistance, instead of helping the family
to get out of debt, was simply the means of providing toys
for experimentation, and that she was being quietly but
persistenly euchred out of all that her heart cherished.
Mr. Farnshaw valued the machinery he was collecting
about him, Mrs. Farnshaw valued the money, partly because
in one way and another it added to the family possessions,
and also because her husband having found out
that he could obtain it through her easier than by direct
appeal, she could avoid unpleasantness with him by insisting
upon her daughter giving it to him; but Elizabeth&#8217;s
education was valued by no one but Elizabeth, and unless
she were to learn her lesson quickly the time for an education
to be obtained would have passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s of no use for you to talk to me, ma,&#8221; Elizabeth
said the spring after she was twenty years old, &#8220;I shall
keep every cent I make this summer. Pa gets into debt
and won&#8217;t let anybody help him out, and I am going to go
to Topeka this fall. I&#8217;m years older right now than the
rest of the scholars will be&mdash;not a single pupil that was
there when I went before will be there&mdash;and I&#8217;m going
to go. I don&#8217;t ever intend to pay the interest on that old
mortgage again&mdash;it&#8217;s just pouring money into a rat-hole!&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 355px;'>
&#8220;&#8216;NOW LOOK HERE, LIZZIE, ... YOUR PA EXPECTS IT&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>It was early morning and they were planting potatoes.
Her mother stood with her back turned toward the raw
April wind as they talked, her old nubia tied loosely about
her head and neck, and her hands red with the cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, Lizzie&#8221;&mdash;Mrs. Farnshaw always refused
to use the full name&mdash;&#8220;your pa expects it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he expects it; that&#8217;s why he keeps adding to
the mortgage; but that don&#8217;t make any difference. I&#8217;m
going to Topeka this fall just the same. I am not going
to pay one dollar on the interest in May, and you can tell
pa if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw was alarmed. Elizabeth had protested
and tried to beg off from the yearly stipend before, but
never in that manner. The tone her daughter had used
frightened her and she quivered with an unacknowledged
fear. Her husband&#8217;s wrath was the Sheol she fought
daily to avoid. What would become of them if the interest
were not paid?</p>
<p>Added to Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s personal desire to command
her daughter&#8217;s funds there was the solid fear of her husband&#8217;s
estimate of her failure. She could not look in his
eye and tell him that she was unable to obtain their
daughter&#8217;s consent. To live in the house with him after
Lizzie had told him herself was equally unthinkable, for
his wrath would be visited upon her own head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My child! My child!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you don&#8217;t have to
be told what he will do t&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long pause while she sobbed. The pause
became a compelling one; some one had to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it, ma,&#8221; Elizabeth said doggedly after a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you don&#8217;t know what it means. Come on to
th&#8217; house. I can&#8217;t work no more, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got t&#8217; talk this
thing out with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They picked up the pails and the hoe with which they
had been covering the hills and went to the house, carrying
a burden that made a potato-planting day a thing of
no consequence.</p>
<p>The mother busied herself with the cob fire as she
argued, and Elizabeth put away the old mittens with
which she had protected her hands from the earth which
never failed to leave them chapped, before she picked up
the broom and began an onslaught on the red and fluffy
dust covering the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, You&#8217;ll go off t&#8217; teach an&#8217; won&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;
about it, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;ll have it t&#8217; bear an&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The
pause was significant.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw watched her daughter furtively and
strained her ears for signs of giving up. At last Elizabeth
said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as sorry as I can be, ma, but&mdash;I&#8217;m twenty years
old, and I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubting that her mind was made up,
and yet her mother threw herself against that stone wall
of determination in frantic despair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie! I can&#8217;t live an&#8217; have you do it.
You don&#8217;t know, child, what I have to bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, ma; you won&#8217;t let me have things out
openly with pa and come to an understanding with him,
and when I told you four years ago that you ought to
leave him if you couldn&#8217;t live with him peaceably you
talked as if I had committed some sort of sin. You and
pa are determined to fuss it out and I can&#8217;t help it, and
I&#8217;ve sacrificed four good years to you and the interest is
bigger than it ever was. I haven&#8217;t helped you one bit.
If you want to go on living with him You&#8217;ll do it in your
own way, but if your life is unbearable, and you want to
leave him, I&#8217;ll see that you are provided for. The law
would give you a share of this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The noise of the broom and of their voices had prevented
them from hearing any other sounds, but a shadow
fell across the middle door and Josiah Farnshaw entered
the kitchen a blazing picture of wrath. Before he could
speak, however, the dog on the doorstep barked sharply at
a stranger who was close upon him, and the irate father was
obliged to smooth his manner.</p>
<p>Elizabeth escaped to the bedroom as her father crossed
to the kitchen to see what the man wanted, and Mr. Farnshaw
went on out to the pens a moment later with the
&#8220;hog buyer,&#8221; as the man proved to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! My God! What have you done?&#8221; Mrs.
Farnshaw cried, following Elizabeth into the bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, ma,&#8221; the girl cried, as white as her
mother. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get off to hunt up a school while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
that man is here. The sun has come out and it&#8217;s only
ten o&#8217;clock. If you&#8217;re afraid, come along,&#8221; she advised,
as she hurried into a clean calico dress and took down her
old black riding skirt from its nail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie!&#8221; the mother exclaimed, as much afraid of the
advice as she was of her husband.</p>
<p>There was little time left her for argument, for Elizabeth
hurriedly tied a thick green veil over her plain straw hat
and left the house. The hog pens were on the opposite
side of the stable from the house and Elizabeth soon had
Patsie, now a mare of five years, saddled and bridled.</p>
<p>The air was softening, and it occurred to her that it
was going to rain, as she hurried out of the yard, but she
did not wait to get extra wraps nor her umbrella. The
best thing to do, she knew, was to get away while that
hog buyer was there and trust to luck for the edge of her
father&#8217;s anger to wear away before she returned.</p>
<p>Fortunately she had worn her old coat, which was heavy
and waterproof, and when it did begin to rain half an
hour later, instead of turning back she pressed forward,
more afraid of the thunderstorm at home than any to be
encountered on the way.</p>
<p>Elizabeth rode steadily southward, thinking out her
share in this new quarrel in which she had embroiled her
parents, unaware that as it drizzled it became warmer and
that the day had become spring-like and endurable. She
began to question the propriety of having suggested drastic
measures to her mother. &#8220;Till death do you part&#8221; rang
in her ears in spite of the certainty that the union of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
mother and her father was an unholy thing which was
damning them more surely than a separation could possibly
do. Of only one thing could Elizabeth be sure: she
saw without mistake at last that she must decide upon
her own duties hereafter without listening to a mother
who could not decide anything for herself.</p>
<p>The director of the district to which Elizabeth first
turned her steps was away from home when she arrived
and it was necessary to consider where she would go next.
After some thought she decided to try the Chamberlain
district, which lay between there and her home. It was
eight miles from the Farnshaw homestead and far enough
away so that she would not have to board with her parents
and she determined to try to meet the school board, which
met usually on the first Tuesday night in April.</p>
<p>The fact of facing around toward the north again set
her to considering what course of action she would pursue
when she went back home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back, I guess, and be patient with whatever he
feels like doing with me,&#8221; she resolved, reflecting that
from her father&#8217;s standpoint he had a very real grievance
against her. &#8220;It was a dreadful thing for him to hear
me advising ma to leave him. I guess I owe it to them
to try to straighten it up. But I don&#8217;t believe it can ever
be straightened up,&#8221; she ended doubtfully.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was passing a grove of young cottonwood
trees and was so absorbed in her thoughts that, becoming
only half conscious that Patsie was lagging and that time
was passing rapidly, she gave her a slap with the strap in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
her hand, urging the horse to a faster pace as she rounded
the corner of the section without looking up. Patsie
broke into a long, easy lope. Suddenly Elizabeth became
conscious of the noise of other hoofs splashing
toward them. Glancing up, she saw a farm team almost
upon them, whose driver was stooped to avoid the rain.</p>
<p>Elizabeth pulled her horse up sharply, and to one side.
The trail was an old one, and the sloping, washed-out rut
was deep. Patsie lost her footing and, after a slipping
plunge or two, fell floundering on her side before her mistress
could support her with the rein. Active as a boy,
Elizabeth loosened her foot from the stirrup and flung
herself to the other side of the road, out of the way of the
dangerous hoofs. Elizabeth slipped as her feet struck
the ground and she landed on &#8220;all-fours&#8221; in the grass.</p>
<p>The young man, suddenly awake to what had happened,
was out of his high seat and had the mare by the bridle
before its rider had fairly scrambled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon! Are you hurt?&#8221; he called across
the wagon, when Patsie, still nervous from her fall, hung
back as far as her rein would permit and not only refused
to be led but threatened to break away altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all! Not a bit! Whoa! Patsie! Whoa!
Lady!&#8221; Elizabeth cried, coming around to them, and
extending a smeary, dripping hand for the taut rein.</p>
<p>The young man let her step in front of him and put her
hand on the strap, but kept his own there as well, while
they both followed the backing horse with braced steps,
the girl talking soothingly to the frightened animal the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
while. The naturally docile filly responded to the voice
she had heard from earliest colthood and soon let Elizabeth
approach close enough to put her hand on the bit.
The seriousness of the affair gave way to the comic when
the horse began to snatch bits of grass from the roadside.</p>
<p>The young couple laughed and looked at each other
rather sheepishly as they saw that further cooperation was
not needed. They untangled their hands where they
had slipped tight together in the loop of the bridle rein as
they had followed the rearing beast.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has broken the girth,&#8221; the young man said, lifting
his hat ceremoniously and with a manner not born of life
on the farm.</p>
<p>He threw the stirrup over the top of the saddle and
fished under the now quiet horse for her dangling surcingle.
Having secured it, he untied the strap and examined
it to see if it were sufficiently long to permit of
tying another knot. Deciding that it was, he tied one
end in the ring in the saddle and, passing the other through
the ring of the girth, drew it up with a strong, steady pull.
His side face against the saddle, as he pulled, permitted
him to examine curiously the young girl in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you are not hurt at all?&#8221; he asked solicitously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit&mdash;only muddy,&#8221; she replied, stooping to
brush her earth-stained hands through the rain-laden
grass at the roadside. He was still working with the
straps when her hands were cleaned and watched her
openly as she shielded her face behind Patsie&#8217;s head while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
waiting. The water dripped from the ends of her braided
brown hair and the long dark lashes of her brown eyes
were mist-laden also. He examined all the accoutrements
of her mount minutely. When at last it occurred
to her that he was giving them extra attention for the
sake of extending the time Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes lighted up
with a humorous twinkle. The young man caught and
rightly interpreted the expression and was embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;m awfully
sorry to have been so stupid. I never thought of meeting
any one in all this rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth took that as a reflection upon her presence
out of doors on such a day, and leading her horse down
into the deep road sprang into the saddle from the bank
before he could offer his assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for helping me,&#8221; she said, and was off
toward the west before he could speak.</p>
<p>She was gone, and he could do nothing but look after
her helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your horse has lamed itself,&#8221; he called when he was
at last able to concern himself with such matters, but
either the spattering hoofbeats prevented her hearing his
voice or she was determined not to reply; he could not
tell which. There was nothing to do but return to his
wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound it!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ve made an
ass of yourself and let her get away without finding out
who she was or where she lived.&#8221; He liked her&mdash;and he
was an ass! He anathematized himself openly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>When well away from the man, Elizabeth saw that his
observation regarding the prospects of meeting people on
such a day was a perfectly natural one and not aimed at
her at all. She laughed at the spectacle she was sure she
must have presented, and wished now that she had not
been in such a hurry in leaving him. Here was a man
worth looking at. The gesture as he had lifted his hat
indicated refinement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curious that I haven&#8217;t seen him&mdash;he lives here some
where,&#8221; she pondered, and now that she could not find
out she rated herself severely for the embarrassment which
was apt to assail her at critical moments.</p>
<p>Patsie limped miserably, and Elizabeth brought her
down to a walk and let her droop along the old country
road, and speculated on this new specimen of masculinity
which had dropped from the skies to puzzle and delight
her soul.</p>
<p>The rain beat heavily now, and Elizabeth began to take
her situation into account after thinking over the stranger
a few minutes. There was a perfect deluge of water from
the burdened sky, and though no sign of a house could be
seen, she knew she could not be far from the Chamberlain
homestead; but the ground was becoming more and more
soggy, and her garments were not of the heaviest. Patsie&#8217;s
feet went ploop, ploop, ploop, in the soft, muddy road.
Elizabeth urged her to the fastest possible walking speed
in spite of her lameness. To trot or gallop was impossible,
and the young horse slipped now and then in a manner
which would have unseated a less skilful rider.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>The sodden Kansas road was aflood with this spring
rain. Patsie laboured heavily and Elizabeth gave herself
up to her cogitations again. Her mind had reacted
to more pleasant subjects than home affairs.</p>
<p>It had been a dreary, disheartening ride, and yet it had
had its compensations, for was not the rider young and
the earth filled with the freshness of spring? The short
and tender grass bordered the road to the very wheel-ruts;
the meadow larks sang regardless of the rain, or mayhap
in sheer meadow-lark delight because of it. To the
south a prairie chicken drummed, and a cow called to her
calf, whose reply came from a point still farther in the
distance. At the sound of the cow&#8217;s lowing Elizabeth
Farnshaw peered delightedly through mists.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it couldn&#8217;t be much farther, Patsie,&#8221; she said,
leaning forward and patting the neck of the dripping
horse. Little spurts of water flew spatteringly from under
the affectionate palm, and Elizabeth shook her bare hand
to free it from the wet hairs which adhered to it, laughing
at her rainsoaked condition.</p>
<p>It was indeed a time for seeking shelter.</p>
<p>Presently the rattle of a chain was heard nearby, then
the outlines of a straw stable were seen, and from the foreground
of mist a man appeared unhitching a team of
horses from a large farm wagon. Patsie gave a little
nicker of anticipation as she scented the sacks of oats,
carefully covered, in the back of the wagon. The old
man rose from his stooping position in unfastening the
tugs and faced the newcomer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Miss Farnshaw! Gee whiz! Be you a duck
t&#8217; be out on such a day as this?&#8221; he inquired, stepping
forward when he saw that she was coming in. Then
chuckling at his own humour, he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you be a goslin&#8217;&mdash;a goslin&#8217; bein&#8217; a young
goose, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Farnshaw laughed. &#8220;But my feathers aren&#8217;t
turning the rain, Mr. Chamberlain.&#8221; It was the second
time within the hour that she had been reminded that
women were not expected to go out of doors in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re such a young goose, you know;
you ain&#8217;t got no feathers yet, it&#8217;s only down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly caught!&#8221; she replied, backing her horse around
so that the rain would come from behind, &#8220;Tell me, does
the school board meet to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; the farmer replied, &#8220;that&#8217;s th&#8217; way th&#8217; wind
blows, is it? Now look here, young lady, if you be as
prompt in lickin&#8217; them youngsters in season an&#8217; out o&#8217;
season as you be in lookin&#8217; up schools I guess You&#8217;ll do.
Yes, sir-ee, th&#8217; school board meets to-night an&#8217; you jes&#8217;
come t&#8217; th&#8217; house an&#8217; have a bite t&#8217; eat an&#8217; we&#8217;ll see what
we can do for you. Why, stars an&#8217; garters!&#8221; he exclaimed
as he lifted her down from her horse, &#8220;Liza Ann &#8217;ll have
t&#8217; put you in th&#8217; oven along with th&#8217; rest of th&#8217; goslins.&#8221;
Then he added: &#8220;Now you run along to th&#8217; house, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll take this horse in hand. I judge by its nicker you
didn&#8217;t stop for no dinner to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chamberlain appeared at the door and her husband
called to her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Liza Ann! here&#8217;s Miss Farnshaw, as wet as that last
brood of chickens you found under th&#8217; corn-planter. Give
&#8217;er a dry pair of shoes an&#8217; take &#8217;er wet coat off o&#8217; &#8217;er.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Elizabeth turned to her hostess, the old man exclaimed,
&#8220;Why, Gosh all Friday, what&#8217;s happened to
your horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully worried about Patsie&#8217;s foot. She slipped
in the muddy road this afternoon. Do you suppose It&#8217;ll
lay her up? It&#8217;s a busy time and pa needs her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; it&#8217;s in a ticklish place. I&#8217;ll rub it good
with Mustang liniment; that&#8217;s th&#8217; best thing I know of.
Now you run on to th&#8217; house; you&#8217;re wet enough t&#8217; wake
up lame yourself in th&#8217; mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he admonished, straightening
up, with his hands on the small of his back.</p>
<p>Having dismissed Elizabeth, Silas Chamberlain took
Patsie&#8217;s saddle from her back and laid it across Old
Queen&#8217;s harness, taking his own team into the barn first.
Old Queen was an unsocial animal and it was necessary
to tie her in the far stall when a strange horse was brought
into the barn, as she had a way of treating intruders badly.
She sniffed at the saddle distrustfully as Mr. Chamberlain
tied her up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa! there!&#8221; he said emphatically, giving her a
slap on the flank which sent her into the opposite corner
of the stall. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be s&#8217; all fired touchy you can&#8217;t
let a strange saddle come into th&#8217; stall. That saddle&#8217;s
carried th&#8217; pluckiest girl in this end of th&#8217; county t&#8217;day.
Gosh-a-livin&#8217;s! Think of her a comin&#8217; out on a day like
this, an&#8217; smilin&#8217; at them wet feathers, as she called &#8217;em,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
&#8217;s if it didn&#8217;t make no difference bein&#8217; wet at all. Now if
John Hunter gets his eyes on &#8217;er there&#8217;ll be an end of ma&#8217;s
board money; an&#8217; then how&#8217;ll I finish payin&#8217; fur that sewin&#8217;
machine?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the house, after some time spent in trying to be
stiffly polite to her guest, the unwilling hostess began the
supper. The potatoes were put on to fry, the kettle
sang, and Mrs. Chamberlain sat down to grind the coffee
in a mill which she grasped firmly between her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you &#8217;uns don&#8217;t drink coffee?&#8221; she remarked
anxiously, stopping to look over at the girl, who sat near
the fire drying her shoes in the oven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Elizabeth answered slowly, coming back
reluctantly from a consideration of the handsome stranger
she had met; &#8220;that is,&#8221; she added confusedly, &#8220;I never
drink anything but water, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chamberlain gave a relieved sigh. &#8220;I was afraid
you&#8217;d rather have tea, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t got no tea in th&#8217; house.
Bein&#8217; farmin&#8217; season now it seems as if I can&#8217;t never get
t&#8217; town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then one adventurous chick which, with the rest
of the brood, had been discovered under the corn-planter
earlier in the day, jumped out of the box in which it had
been kept near the fire. Mrs. Chamberlain set the mill
on the table and gave chase to the runaway.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s th&#8217; peertest chicken of th&#8217; lot,&#8221; she remarked as
she again enveloped him in the old woollen skirt, from the
folds of which came much distressed cheeping. &#8220;They&#8217;re
hungry, I think,&#8221; she added, reaching for a bowl of yellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
cornmeal which she mixed with water. Lifting the skirt
off the little brood carefully, and giving it a cautious shake
to assure herself that no unwary chick was caught in its
folds, she dropped some of the mixture in the middle of
the box, tapping lightly with the spoon to call the attention
of the chicks to its presence. The chickens pecked
hungrily, and there was a satisfied note in the twitterings
of the downy little group as Mrs. Chamberlain turned to
the preparation of her supper again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s th&#8217; peertest chicken of th&#8217; lot; an&#8217; I&#8217;d most
as soon he&#8217;d been more like th&#8217; rest&mdash;he&#8217;s always gettin&#8217;
out of th&#8217; box.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Liza Ann, you ain&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; nothin&#8217; of th&#8217; kind,&#8221;
said her husband, who had hurried with his evening chores
so as to get a chance to visit with the company and had
just come in from the stable. &#8220;You know you said yourself,
&#8216;Thank goodness, there&#8217;s one on &#8217;em alive,&#8217; when you
fished &#8217;em out from under that planter. Th&#8217; same thing&#8217;s
keeping &#8217;im on th&#8217; go now that kept &#8217;im from givin&#8217; up as
quick as th&#8217; rest did then. Chicken&#8217;s is like boys, Miss
Farnshaw,&#8221; Silas continued, addressing Elizabeth; &#8220;th&#8217;
ones that makes th&#8217; most trouble when thy&#8217;re little, you
can count on as bein&#8217; th&#8217; most likely when they&#8217;re growed
up. Now, Liza Ann there counted on that chicken soon&#8217;s
ever she set eyes on &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having washed his face and hands in the tin basin on
the bench just outside the kitchen door, Silas Chamberlain
combed his curly locks of iron gray before the little looking
glass which was so wrinkled that he looked like some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
fantastic caricature when mirrored on its surface. After
a short grace at the opening of the meal, he passed a dish
of potatoes, remarking:</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t much hands t&#8217; wait on th&#8217; table, Miss Farnshaw;
You&#8217;ll have t&#8217; reach an&#8217; help yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this plate for?&#8221; Elizabeth asked at last, designating
the vacant place at her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s John&#8217;s,&#8221; said Mrs. Chamberlain.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Hunter&#8217;s, Miss Farnshaw,&#8221; said Silas. &#8220;He&#8217;s
our boarder, an&#8217; th&#8217; likeliest young man in these parts.&#8221;
Then he added with conviction, &#8220;You two be goin&#8217; t&#8217; like
each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>A girlish blush covered the well-tanned cheeks, and to
hide her embarrassment Elizabeth said with a laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;Describe this beau ideal of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Si, do let th&#8217; child alone,&#8221; Mrs. Chamberlain
protested. &#8220;He&#8217;s always got t&#8217; tease,&#8221; she added deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I be an&#8217; sometimes not. Miss Farnshaw
made me think of you some way when I see her this afternoon.&#8221;
Noting his wife&#8217;s look of surprise, he explained:
&#8220;I mean when I see you down to th&#8217; Cherryvale meetin&#8217;
house. An&#8217; it didn&#8217;t take me long t&#8217; make up my mind
after that, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chamberlain smiled at the mention of girlhood
days, but said nothing, and Silas turned to Elizabeth again
with his honest face alight with memories of youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Miss Farnshaw, I&#8217;d gone out on th&#8217; hunt of a
stray calf, an&#8217; an unexpected shower came on&mdash;th&#8217; kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
that rains with th&#8217; sun still a shinin&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; I dug my heels
into old Charlie&#8217;s flanks an&#8217; hurried along down th&#8217; road
to th&#8217; meeting house, a few rods farther on, when what
should I see but a pretty girl on th&#8217; steps of that same
place of refuge! Well, I begged &#8217;er pardon, but I stayed
on them there steps till that shower cleared off. Most
of th&#8217; time I was a prayin&#8217; that another cloud would appear,
an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t want it no bigger than a man&#8217;s hand
neither. No, sir-ee, I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; cared if it&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been as
big as th&#8217; whole Bay of Biscay. An&#8217; what I was thinkin&#8217;
jest now was that there was about th&#8217; same fundamental
differences &#8217;tween you an&#8217; John Hunter that th&#8217; was
&#8217;tween Liza Ann an&#8217; me. He&#8217;s light haired an&#8217; blue eyed,
an tall an&#8217; slim, an&#8217; he&#8217;s openin&#8217; up a new farm, an&#8217; &#8217;ll
need a wife. He talks of his mother comin&#8217; out t&#8217; keep
house for him, but, law&#8217;s sakes! she wasn&#8217;t raised on a
farm an&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about farm work. Oh,
yes, I forgot t&#8217; tell you th&#8217; best part of my story: I got t&#8217;
carry Miss Liza Ann Parkins home on old Charlie, &#8217;cause
th&#8217; crick rose over th&#8217; banks outen th&#8217; clouds of rain I
prayed for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Si Chamberlain, there ain&#8217;t a word of truth in
that, an&#8217; you know it,&#8221; said his wife, passing Elizabeth a
hot biscuit. &#8220;I walked home by th&#8217; turnpike road, Miss
Farnshaw, though we did wait a bit, till it dried up a
little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband&#8217;s laugh rang out; he had trapped Liza Ann
into the discussion, in spite of herself, and he had trapped
her into an admission as well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I may be mistaken about th&#8217; details,
but I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot in my heart for th&#8217; rainy
days since that particular time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told me why Mr. Hunter isn&#8217;t here
to eat his supper,&#8221; said Elizabeth, &#8220;nor have you told me
what he is like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s gone over to Colebyville for his mail, an&#8217;
won&#8217;t be home till late&mdash;in all this mud. As to what he&#8217;s
like&mdash;it ain&#8217;t easy t&#8217; tell what John&#8217;s like; he&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s a
university feller; most folks say he&#8217;s a dude, but we like
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What university?&#8221; Elizabeth asked with a quick indrawn
breath; she knew now whom she had met on the
road that afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes from Illinois. I guess it&#8217;s th&#8217; State University&mdash;I
never asked him. His father died an&#8217; left
him this land an&#8217; he&#8217;s come out here to farm it. Couldn&#8217;t
plow a straight furrow t&#8217; save his life when he come a little
over a year ago, but he&#8217;s picked up right smart,&#8221; Silas
added, thereby giving the information the young girl
wanted.</p>
<p>This young man was to be in this neighbourhood all
summer. Still another reason for applying for the Chamberlain
school.</p>
<p>As Elizabeth helped Liza Ann with her dishwashing
after supper, John Hunter came in. The ground had been
too soft for them to hear the wagon when he drove
up. Silas introduced them promptly and added with
a grin:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of folks that didn&#8217;t know enough t&#8217;
come in out of th&#8217; rain? Well, that&#8217;s her!&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter&#8217;s eyes twinkled an amused recognition,
but he did not mention the accident in which Patsie had
come to grief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to meet you, Miss Farnshaw; we are
both wet weather birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing Liza Ann reach for a frying pan, he addressed
himself to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind any supper for me, Mrs. Chamberlain.
I knew I&#8217;d be late, as I had to go around by Warren&#8217;s after
I got back, and I got an early supper at the new hotel before
I left town!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The extravagance of that!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Chamberlain,
to whom hotel bills were unknown.</p>
<p>John Hunter went to the door to clean some extra mud
off his boot tops, and to hide a wide and fatuous smile at
the thought of tricking Silas out of his accustomed joke.
He felt nearer the girl, because she too had been silent
regarding the afternoon encounter. He liked the mutuality
of it and resolved that it should not be the last
touch of that sort between them. While not really
intellectual, John Hunter had the polish and tastes
of the college man, and here he reflected was a girl who
seemed near being on his own level. She looked, he
thought, as if she could see such small matters as bespattered
clothes.</p>
<p>Silas followed him out. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t bed them horses
down did you?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. I expect we&#8217;d better do it now and have it out
of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they entered the dark stable and felt their way along
the back of the little alley, behind the stalls, for the pitchforks,
the younger man asked indifferently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did you say the young lady was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; shouted Silas; &#8220;it didn&#8217;t take you long. I
knew you&#8217;d be courtin&#8217; of me along with your questions.
Now look here, John Hunter, you can&#8217;t go an&#8217; carry this
schoolma&#8217;am off till this here term&#8217;s finished. I look
fur Carter an&#8217; that new director over to-night, for a
school meetin&#8217;, an&#8217; I&#8217;m blamed if I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; have
you cuttin&#8217; into our plans&mdash;no, sirr-ee&mdash;she&#8217;s t&#8217; be
left free t&#8217; finish up this school, anyhow, if I help &#8217;er
get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger! You get her the school; but how does
she come to have that air away out here? Does she come
from some town near here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Town nothin&#8217;! She was jest raised on these prairies,
same as th&#8217; rest of us. Ain&#8217;t she a dandy! No, sir&mdash;&#8217;er
father&#8217;s a farmer&mdash;&#8217;bout as common as any of us, an&#8217;
she ain&#8217;t had no different raisin&#8217;. She&#8217;s different in &#8217;erself
somehow. Curious thing how one body&#8217;ll have a
thing an&#8217; another won&#8217;t, an&#8217; can&#8217;t seem t&#8217; get it, even when
he wants it an&#8217; tries. Now you couldn&#8217;t make nothin&#8217;
but jest plain farmer out of me, no matter what you done
t&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll give her the school?&#8221; John asked.</p>
<p>Silas&#8217;s laugh made the young man uncomfortable. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
had intended to avoid the necessity for it, but had forgotten
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Carter now,&#8221; was all the reply the old man
gave as he moved toward the door, which he could dimly
see now that he had been in the darkness long enough for
his eyes to become accustomed to it. The splashing footsteps
of a horse and the voice of a man cautioning it came
from toward the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Carter?&#8221; Silas called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. This ground&#8217;s fairly greasy to-night,&#8221; answered
the voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring your horse in here; there&#8217;s room under cover for
it,&#8221; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>They tied it in the darkness, feeling their way from strap
to manger. &#8220;The Farnshaw girl&#8217;s here waitin&#8217; fur th&#8217;
school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad of that,&#8221; replied the newcomer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
her very well, but they say she can handle youngsters.
She&#8217;s had some extry schoolin&#8217; too. Don&#8217;t know as that
makes any difference in a summer term, but it&#8217;s never in
th&#8217; way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man slipped out of the stable, intending to
get a word with the new teacher before the others came
to the house. The school was assured to her with two
members of the board in her favour, he reflected. Liza
Ann had gone to the other room, and finding the way clear
he asked in a half whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you lame your horse badly?&#8221; And when Elizabeth
only nodded and looked as if she hoped her hostess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
had not heard, John Hunter was filled with joy. The
mutuality of the reticence put them on the footing of good
fellowship. There was no further opportunity for conversation,
as they heard Silas and Carter on the step and
a third party hail them from a distance.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s delay and when the door did at
last open Elizabeth Farnshaw gave a glad cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nate! Where in the world did you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught Nathan Hornby by the lapels of his wet
overcoat and stood him off from her, looking at him in
such a transport of joy that they were the centre of an
admiring and curious group instantly.</p>
<p>While Nathan explained that they had only last month
traded their wooded eighty for a hundred and sixty acres
of prairie land in this district, and that it had been their
plan to surprise her the next Sunday by driving over to
see her before she had heard that they were in that part
of the state, Elizabeth sat on the edge of the wood-box
and still held to his coat as if afraid the vision might
vanish from her sight, and asked questions twice as fast
as the pleased old man could answer them, and learned
that Nathan had been appointed to fill out the unexpired
term of the moderator of the Chamberlain school district,
with whom he had traded for the land. The business of
the evening was curtailed to give the pair a chance to talk,
and when the contract was signed, Elizabeth said that she
would go home with Nathan, and John Hunter thrust
himself into the felicitous arrangement by taking the
young girl over in his farm wagon, it being decided that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Patsie&#8217;s lameness made it best for her to remain housed
in Silas&#8217;s barn for the night.</p>
<p>It was a mile and a half along soggy roads to Nathan
Hornby&#8217;s, and John Hunter made as much of the time
fortune had thrown at him as possible. They sat under
one umbrella, and found the distance short, and John told
her openly that he was glad she was to be in his neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>REACHING HUNGRY HANDS TOWARD A SYMBOL</h3>
</div>

<p>Susan Hornby&#8217;s delight over Elizabeth&#8217;s coming
was the most satisfying thing Nathan had
seen since his return from Topeka. He had traded
the land to please his wife, by getting nearer Elizabeth,
but the presence of the girl in the house was so overwhelmingly
surprising that Susan was swept by its very
suddenness into shedding tears of actual joy. Elizabeth
was put to the disconcerting necessity of explaining that
her mother somewhat resented Aunt Susan&#8217;s influence
upon her daughter&#8217;s life when she found her friends enthusiastically
planning visits in the near future. She
softened the details as much as possible and passed it
over as only a bit of maternal jealousy, but was obliged
to let this dear friend see that it was rather a serious
matter in her calculations. Susan Hornby now understood
why Elizabeth had never visited her in these four
years.</p>
<p>With the eyes of love Aunt Susan saw that four years
in a position of authority had ripened her darling, and
made of her a woman of wit and judgment, who could tell
a necessary thing in a right manner or with a reserve which
was commendable. Eagerly she studied her to see what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the changes of those formative years had brought her.
She listened to Elizabeth&#8217;s plans for going to Topeka, and
rejoiced that the intellectual stimulus was still strong in
her. Elizabeth was obliged to explain away her parent&#8217;s
attitude regarding further education, and left much for
the older woman to fill in by her intuitions and experience
of the world, but there again Susan Hornby saw evidences
of strength which made her feel that the loss was offset
by power gained. Elizabeth Farnshaw had matured and
had qualities which would command recognition. John
Hunter had shown that he recognized them&mdash;a thing
which Elizabeth without egotism also knew.</p>
<p>It was a new experience to go to sleep thinking of any
man but Hugh. In the darkness of the little bedroom in
which Elizabeth slept that night Hugh&#8217;s priority was met
face to face by John Hunter&#8217;s proximity. Possession is
said to be nine points in the law, and John Hunter was on
the ground. The girl had been shut away from those of
her kind until her hungry hands in that hour of thought,
reached out to the living presence of the cultured man,
and her hungry heart prayed to heaven that she might not
be altogether unpleasing to him.</p>
<p>In the hour spent with John Hunter she had learned
that he had come to Kansas to open a farm on the only
unmortgaged piece of property which his father had left
him when he died; that his mother intended to come to
him as soon as he had a house built; and by an accidental
remark she had also learned that there were lots in some
eastern town upon which enough money could be raised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
to stock the farm with calves and that it was the young
man&#8217;s intention to farm this land himself. It seemed so
incredible that John Hunter should become a farmer that
by her astonished exclamation over it she had left him
self-satisfied at her estimate of his foreignness to the life
he was driven to pursue.</p>
<p>Elizabeth saw that if John Hunter must needs run a
farm that he would do his best at it, but that he did not
wish to <i>appear</i> one with a rôle, and being young and with
her own philosophy of life in a very much muddled condition,
she liked him the better for it. Crucified daily by
the incongruities of her own home, she craved deliverance
from it and all it represented.</p>
<p>Just now Elizabeth Farnshaw was going home with
something akin to fear in her heart. She rated herself
soundly for the useless advice she had thrust upon her
mother and for the entangling difficulties which her
thoughtless words had produced. That the union of her
parents was unclean, that it was altogether foul and by
far worse than a divorce, she still felt confident, but she
saw that her mother was totally unable to comprehend the
difference between a clean separate life and the nagging
poison dealt out as daily bread to the husband with whom
she lived; but she saw that because of that very inability
to understand the difference, the mother must be left to
find the light in her own way. In her desire to help,
Elizabeth had but increased her mother&#8217;s burdens, and
she tried to assume an attitude of added tenderness toward
her in her own mind, and puckered her young face into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
frown as she let Patsie limp slowly from one low hill to
another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do everything I can to square the deal for ma,&#8221;
she resolved, but in her heart there was a sick suspicion
that all she could do was not much, and that it had small
chance really to avail.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had started early for home, but the sun rode
high in the heavens before she arrived. Albert, who was
herding the cattle on the short grass a half mile from
home, warned her as she passed that she would do well to
hurry to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa waited for you to do the milking, Bess, an&#8217; you
didn&#8217;t come. He&#8217;s mad as a hornet, an&#8217; You&#8217;ll have t&#8217;
bring th&#8217; cows out after he gets through.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a friendly warning. To be milking at that hour,
when all the men in the neighbourhood were already following
plow and harrow, was an important matter on
the farm. Plainly it had been arranged to make Elizabeth
feel a hindrance to the business of getting in the
crops, and it was with increased apprehension that she
approached home.</p>
<p>The storm broke as soon as she was within hailing
distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time you brought that horse home, young lady.
You see to it that it&#8217;s harnessed for th&#8217; drag as quick as
ever you can. Next time you get a horse You&#8217;ll know
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Elizabeth started on and Mr. Farnshaw saw
that Patsie was lame his anger knew no bounds, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
sound of his exasperated voice could have been heard half
a mile away as he poured out a stream of vituperation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth dodged into the barn as soon as its friendly
door could be reached, thankful that the cows were as far
as they were from it. Joe was harnessing a team in the
far corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better shy around pa, Sis; and get t&#8217; th&#8217; house,&#8221;
he cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. He told me to harness Patsie, but she&#8217;s so
lame I know she can&#8217;t work&mdash;what will I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she can&#8217;t work, she can&#8217;t. How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She strained herself just before I got to Mr. Chamberlain&#8217;s.
I was passing a young man by the name of
Hunter and she fell flat. Say, do you know anything
about Mr. Hunter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. Jimmie Crane says he&#8217;s a stuck-up, who&#8217;s
goin&#8217; t&#8217; show us country jakes how t&#8217; farm; but th&#8217; best
thing you can do is t&#8217; get in an&#8217; not let pa get any excuse
for a row.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw had taken the milkpails to the house while
they were talking and it was Elizabeth&#8217;s fate to encounter
him on the doorstep as she ran up to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry about the horse, pa. I hurried this
morning, but Patsie was so lame and I had to come all
the way from the Chamberlain district. The Haddon
school board didn&#8217;t meet this week and the director of
number Twelve was away, and it was so late last night
that I couldn&#8217;t get home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve always got a good excuse. I bet you didn&#8217;t
get a school after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had been edging toward the door as her father
was speaking and now made her escape to the inside of
the house as she replied over her shoulder in a perfectly
respectful tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I did, and it begins Monday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s better than I expected. Now see to it that
you get that riding skirt off an&#8217; come an&#8217; drive my team
while I finish them oats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The daughter stopped where she stood and was going
to reply that she must get ready if she were to go to Aunt
Susan&#8217;s the next day, but on second thought closed her
mouth down firmly. She knew she would do well if she
escaped with no harder tax laid upon her temper than
that of putting off her arrival at the Hornby home, and
she turned to do as she was bidden.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth found her homecoming unpleasant
and her father sullen and evidently nursing his wrath, she
faced the storm without protest, took all that was said
quietly, helped in the fields and endeavoured to make up
for her unfortunate words in every helpful way possible.
In all, she was so subtly generous with her assistance that it
was impossible to bring on a quarrel with her, and the sour
demeanour of her father was so carefully handled that
Friday arrived without an open break having occurred.
A new dress had been one of the longed-for accomplishments
of the week&#8217;s work, but certain of Aunt Susan&#8217;s
help when she was safely entrenched in her home, Elizabeth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
retired to the attic whenever she saw her father
approach the house. His attitude was threatening, but
the anxious girl was able to delay the encounter. It
could only be <i>delayed</i>, for Mr. Farnshaw made a virtue
of not forgetting unpleasant things.</p>
<p>The only unfortunate occurrence of the week was the
presence of Sadie Crane and her mother when Mr. Hunter
drove up to the back door for Elizabeth&#8217;s trunk, but even
this had had its beneficial side, for Josiah Farnshaw had
been mending harness, because a shower had made the
ground too wet to plow, and the presence of neighbours
made it possible to get the trunk packed without unpleasantness.
When John Hunter drove up to the back door,
Mr. Farnshaw rose from his chair beside the window and
went to help put his daughter&#8217;s possessions in the wagon.
Sadie crossed over to the window to get a look at Lizzie&#8217;s
new beau.</p>
<p>Sadie Crane was now sixteen years old, and being undersized
and childish of appearance had never had the pleasure
of the company of a young man. The yearning in
her pettish face as she stood unevenly on the discarded
harness, looking out of the window toward John Hunter,
caught Elizabeth&#8217;s attention and illuminated the whole
affair to the older girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dude!&#8221; Sadie exclaimed spitefully, facing about and
evidently offering insult.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth Farnshaw had seen the unsatisfied look
which preceded the remark and it was excused. Sadie was
just Sadie, and not to be taken seriously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better soak his head; he can&#8217;t farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one replied, and Elizabeth said hurried good-byes
and escaped.</p>
<p>But though Sadie Crane was undersized and spoke
scornfully, she was old enough to feel a woman&#8217;s desires
and dream a woman&#8217;s dreams. She watched the pair
drive away together in pleasant converse on the quilt-lined
spring seat of the farm wagon, and swallowed a sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie always had th&#8217; best of everything,&#8221; she reflected.</p>
<p>The roads were slippery and gave an excuse for driving
slowly, and the young man exerted himself to be agreeable.
The distaste for the presence of the Cranes at her home
when he came for her, his possible opinion of her family
and friends, the prolonged struggle with her father, even
the headache from which she had not been free for days,
melted out of Elizabeth&#8217;s mind in the joy of that ride,
and left it a perfect experience. It began to rain before
they were halfway to their destination, and they sat
shoulder to shoulder under the umbrella, with one of the
quilts drawn around both. There was a sack of butterscotch,
and they talked of Scott, and Dickens, and the
other books Elizabeth Farnshaw had absorbed from Aunt
Susan&#8217;s old-fashioned library; and Elizabeth was surprised
to find that she had read almost as much as this
college man, and still more surprised to find that she remembered
a great deal more of what she had read than
he seemed to do. She asked many questions about his
college experiences and learned that he had lacked but a
year and a half of graduation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you finish?&#8221; she asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, father died, and I didn&#8217;t have hardly
enough to finish on, so I thought I&#8217;d come out here and
get to making something. I didn&#8217;t care to finish. I&#8217;d had
my fun out of it. I wish I hadn&#8217;t gone at all. If I&#8217;d
gone into the office with my father and been admitted
to the Bar it would have been better for me. I wouldn&#8217;t
have been on the farm then,&#8221; he said regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you go into the law? You could
have made it by yourself,&#8221; Elizabeth said, understanding
that it hurt John Hunter&#8217;s pride to farm.</p>
<p>The young man shrugged his dripping shoulders and
pulled the quilt tighter around them as he answered indifferently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very well. Father left very little unmortgaged
except mother&#8217;s own property, and I thought I&#8217;d get out
of Canton. It ain&#8217;t easy to live around folks you know
unless you have money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you could have worked your way through college;
lots of boys do it,&#8221; the girl objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life!&#8221; John Hunter exclaimed emphatically.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t go to college that way.&#8221; After a few
moments&#8217; musing he added slowly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make money
enough to get out of here after a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish I&#8217;d had your chance,&#8221; Elizabeth said with
a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about something cheerful,&#8221; young Hunter
replied, when he realized that the ride was nearly over.
&#8220;When may I come to see you again?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
are to see a good deal of me this summer if you will permit
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Farnshaw caught a happy breath before she
replied. He wanted to come; she was to see much of him
this summer if she would permit it! Could nature and
fate ask for more?</p>
<p>When Elizabeth arrived, the old couple bustled about
the bright carpeted room, making it comfortable, and
cooing over the return of their prodigal, till a heaven of
homeness was made of her advent.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Elizabeth, dry and warm and with a
cup of tea beside her which she had found it easier to
accept than to refuse, looked about her and invoiced the
changes of four years which in her preoccupied state of
mind during her former visit she had neglected to think
upon. There were many little changes in the household
arrangement, due to the observations of the winter spent
in Topeka. In personal appearance Aunt Susan herself
showed improvement.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth&#8217;s attention was turned to Nathan,
however, the glad little enumeration became a more sober
one. In the days when they had fed the motherless Patsie
together Nathan Hornby had been portly, even inclined
to stoutness, and his face, though tough from wind
and sun, inclined to be ruddy. The genial gray eyes had
sparkled with confidence in himself and good-will toward
all about him. At Silas Chamberlain&#8217;s house a week ago
the girl had noticed that Nathan let others arrange the
business details of contracts and credentials, but his joy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
at meeting her had obscured the habitual sadness of his
present manner. She had noticed that he was thinner,
but to-night she saw the waste and aging which had consumed
him. The belt line which had bulged comfortably
under the vest of five years ago was flat and flabby, the
thick brown hair which had shown scarcely a thread of
white was now grizzled and thin, the ruddy cheeks had
fallen in, and two missing lower teeth made him whistle his
s&#8217;es through the gap with a sound unlike his bluff speech
of their first acquaintance, so that without the face which
accompanied the words she could hardly have recognized
the connection between the man who had and the man
who did embody the same personality. The cogitations
of the first half hour in the white counterpaned bed that
night left Elizabeth in a maze of wonder over his physical
as well as mental collapse.</p>
<p>Aunt Susan was evidently aware of changes also, for
she hovered over him solicitously. Nathan Hornby was
a broken man.</p>
<p>School opened auspiciously on Monday; John Hunter
came and stayed to walk home with Elizabeth on Tuesday
afternoon, and the glad weeks which followed were but
the happy record of so many rides, walks, and talks, and
the dreams of Elizabeth Farnshaw and John Hunter. He
was with the girl daily. Elizabeth never expressed the
smallest desire for anything human hand could obtain
for her that John Hunter did not instantly assure her that
she should receive it. If she stayed to sweep out the
schoolhouse, John would almost certainly appear at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
door before she had finished&mdash;his fields commanded a
view of her comings and goings&mdash;if she went to Carter&#8217;s
to have a money order cashed he accompanied her; if she
wished to go anywhere she had but to mention it and John
Hunter and his team were at her service.</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not have been otherwise than happy.
The spring, with its freshness and promise, was symbolical
of the gladsome currents of her life that joyous April and
May. Her lightest wish was the instant consideration of
the man she admired above all others, and that man, in
refinement of appearance and knowledge of the world,
was as far above those of the country community in
which they lived as the sun was above the smoky kerosene
lamps by which the members of that community lighted
themselves to bed.</p>
<p>John Hunter, during the season of his courtship, served
the girl of his choice almost upon his knees. He made her
feel that she could command his services, his time, and
himself. By his request he ceased to ask when he could
come again, but encouraged, even commanded, her to
tell him when and where she wished to be taken and
to let him come to see her unannounced. He paid
tribute to her as if she had been a goddess and he her
devotee.</p>
<p>Silas looked on and chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t take &#8217;em long,&#8221; he remarked to Liza Ann, and
when as usual his wife did not reply, he added: &#8220;Glad
we&#8217;re to have &#8217;em for neighbours. She&#8217;s about th&#8217; liveliest
meadow lark on these prairies, an&#8217; if she don&#8217;t sing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
on a fence post it&#8217;s &#8217;cause she ain&#8217;t built that way, an&#8217;
can&#8217;t; she&#8217;s full enough to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby looked on and had her misgivings. She
saw the devotion the young man poured out at her darling&#8217;s
feet, and she knew that it was the fervour of the
courting time in a man&#8217;s life that made him abandon his
own interests and plans while he plumed himself and pursued
his desired mate. She saw the rapturous, dreamy
look of love and mating time in Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes, and she
knew that the inevitable had happened, but she was not
content. Premonitions which she sought to strangle
shook her whenever the pair wandered away on real or
fictitious errands. She saw that no word of love had yet
been spoken, but every look cried it aloud and the day
could not be far distant.</p>
<p>Between corn planting and corn plowing the foundations
of the new house had been laid and work on it had
progressed fitfully and whenever the young man could
find time to help the occasional mason who laid brick
and stone for simple foundations, and who had crops of
his own to tend between times. The work had progressed
slowly, but at last the wall had been finished
and the carpenters had come to do their share. It gave
excuse for many trips in the evening twilight. They
usually went on horseback, and Silas&#8217;s pony with
Liza Ann&#8217;s sidesaddle on its back had more business
on hand that month than in all the other years of its lazy
existence.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby watched the pair ride away one evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
the first week in June. Nathan stood at her side on the
doorstep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he loves her; how could he help it? and
yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, what?&#8221; Nathan asked impatiently. &#8220;She
wants him, an&#8217; he wants her, an&#8217; you stand there lookin&#8217;
as if that wasn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby turned to her husband with some uncertainty
regarding his comprehension of the subject, and
with a gentle patience with his mood. Nathan was often
impatient of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know&mdash;only it seems as if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now what&#8217;s lacking?&#8221; her husband asked when
she again broke off the sentence doubtfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s got
a good farm, an&#8217; he needs a wife to help him run it. From
what he says, his mother&#8217;s too old t&#8217; be of any help. He
can&#8217;t run it alone, an&#8217; seems t&#8217; me it&#8217;s a good thing for
both of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it!&#8221; Susan Hornby broke out, turning
back, her eyes following the progress of the pair toward
the crimson west, her thoughts running ahead to the unknown
future where the progress of the soul would be
helped or hindered; &#8220;that&#8217;s just it! He has a farm; now
he&#8217;s going to need a wife to help run it&mdash;just as he needs
a horse. If he&#8217;d only be fair about it, but he&#8217;s misleading
her. She thinks he&#8217;ll always do things the way he&#8217;s doing
them now, and he won&#8217;t; there&#8217;ll be an end to that kind of
thing some day&mdash;and&mdash;and when they&#8217;re married and
he&#8217;s got her fast, that kind of man won&#8217;t be nice about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
it&mdash;and&mdash;they&#8217;ll live on the farm&mdash;and life&#8217;s so hard
sometimes! Oh! I can&#8217;t bear to see her broken to it!&#8221;
she cried with such intensity that the man at her side
caught his breath with a sort of sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody&#8217;d think to hear you talk, Susan, that marryin&#8217;
was a thing to be feared, an&#8217; that I&#8217;d been mean t&#8217;
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>What had she done? There was a half-frightened pause
as Susan Hornby struggled to bring herself back to the
husband standing beside her who was broken by failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your old soul, Nate,&#8221; she answered quickly, and
with the flush of confusion on her face strangely like the
flush of guilt, &#8220;if he&#8217;s only half as good to her as you&#8217;ve
been to me, She&#8217;ll never have anything to complain of
nor need anybody&#8217;s sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan understood that her assurance did not wholly reassure
that bleeding heart, and to turn Nathan&#8217;s thoughts
to other things she slipped one hand through his arm, and
picking up the milk pails from the bench at her side with
the other, said with a little laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;There now! I&#8217;ll do your milking for that. You
throw down the hay while I do it. There&#8217;s nothing the
matter with you and me, except that I&#8217;ve done a washing
to-day and you don&#8217;t sleep well of late. I haven&#8217;t one
thing in all this world to complain of, and this would be
the happiest year of my life if you weren&#8217;t a bit gloomy
and under the weather. Come on&mdash;I&#8217;m nervous. You
know I never am well in hot weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan knew that Susan was really worried over Elizabeth&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
prospects, but her luckless remark upon the marriage
of farmers cut into his raw, quivering consciousness
of personal failure like a saw-bladed knife, torturing the
flesh as it went. His failure to place her where her own
natural characteristics and attainments deserved had
eaten into his mind like acid. In proportion as he loved
her and acknowledged her worth he was humiliated by the
fact that she was not getting all out of life of which she
was capable, as his wife, and it left him sensitive regarding
her possible estimate of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;She always seems satisfied,&#8221; he said to himself as he
turned his pitchfork to get a hold on the pile into which
he had thrust it, &#8220;but here she is pityin&#8217; this here girl
that&#8217;s goin&#8217; t&#8217; be married as if she goin&#8217; t&#8217; be damned.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Adam&#8217;s apple in his wrinkled throat tightened
threateningly, and to keep down any unmanly weakness
it indicated he fell upon the hay savagely, but the suspicion
stayed with him and left its bitter sting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;DIDN&#8217;T TAKE &#8217;EM LONG&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>John Hunter and Elizabeth Farnshaw rode
away in the cool summer evening, wholly unconscious
of the thoughts of others. The sun
had dropped behind the low hills in front of them, and as
they rode along, the light-floating clouds were dyed blazing
tints of red and gold, as glowing and rosy as life itself
appeared to the young pair. Elizabeth took off her hat
and let the cool evening breeze blow through the waves of
hair on her temples and about the smooth braids which,
because of the heat of the prematurely hot summer day,
had been wound about her head. Her eyes were dreamy
and her manner detached as she let the pony wander a
half length ahead of its companion, and she was unaware
that John was not talking. She was just drinking
in the freshness of the evening breeze and sky, scarcely
conscious of any of her surroundings, glad as a kitten
to be alive, and as unaware of self as a young animal
should be.</p>
<p>John Hunter rode at her side, watching the soft curls
on her round girlish neck, athrob and athrill with her
presence, and trying to formulate the thing he had brought
her out to say. It was not till they were turning into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
lane beside the new house that his companion realized
that he had been more than usually quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a Quaker to-night, evidently, and do not
speak till the spirit moves, Mr. Hunter,&#8221; she said, facing
about near the gateway and waiting for him to ride alongside.</p>
<p>The young man caught the cue. &#8220;I wish you would call
me John. I&#8217;ve been intending to ask you for some time.
I have a given name,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you do the same?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call myself John?&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>They both laughed as if a great witticism had been perpetrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, call me by my given name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, Bess, Elizabeth, or Sis?&#8221; he asked, remembering
the various nicknames of her family.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may call me whatever you choose,&#8221; she answered,
drawing the pony up where they were to dismount.</p>
<p>John Hunter stepped to the ground and with his bridle
rein over his arm came around to the left side of her pony.
Laying one hand on its neck and the other on the hand
that grasped its bridle, he looked up into her face earnestly
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to call you &#8216;Wife,&#8217; if I may, Elizabeth,&#8221;
and held up his arms quickly to help her from the saddle.</p>
<p>When she was on the ground before him he barred
her way and stood, pulsing and insistent, waiting for her
answer.</p>
<p>It was a full minute before either moved, she looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
down at their feet, he looking at her and trying to be sure
he could push his claims.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth did look up it was with her eyes brimming
shyly over with happy tears, and without waiting
for her answer in words, John Hunter gathered her into
his arms and smothered her face in kisses.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they tied the horses to the new hitching
post and passed into the yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is to be your house and mine, dearie,&#8221; the young
man said, and then looked down at her to see why she did
not answer.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was walking toward the house which was to
be hers, oblivious of time and place, almost unconscious of
the man at her side, stunned by the unexpectedness of this
precious gift of love which had just been offered her. As
they stepped upon the little back porch, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought you over to ask your advice about the stairway;
the carpenters want to leave one step in the sitting
room. It&#8217;ll be back far enough from the chimney to be
out of the way and it makes their calculations easier about
the stairs somehow. What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was altogether too new in the sense of possession
to grasp the full significance of the question. John
Hunter laughed at the look she turned upon him and said,
with a large and benevolent wave of the hand, indicating
the entire premises:</p>
<p>&#8220;The house is yours, little girl, and you are to have it
as you want it. The only desire I have on earth is to do
things for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth shot a quick look of joy up to him. &#8220;No one
but Aunt Susan has ever wanted to do anything for me,&#8221;
she said, and opening her arms held them out to him, crying,
&#8220;Am I to be happy? John! John! do you love me,
really?&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was the burden of their conversation during
the entire stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be possible, John,&#8221; the happy girl said at one
point. &#8220;I have never known love&mdash;and&mdash;and I want
it till I could die for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so you don&#8217;t die <i>of</i> it, You&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; John
Hunter replied, and went home from Nathan&#8217;s, later,
whistling a merry tune. He had not known that love
poured itself out with such abandonment. It was a new
feature of the little god&#8217;s manoeuvring, but John doubted
not that it was the usual thing where a girl really cared
for a man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll farm the whole place next year, and It&#8217;ll be different
from boarding at the Chamberlains&#8217;, where they don&#8217;t
have any napkins and the old man sucks his coffee out of
his saucer as if it hurt him. Mother &#8217;ll like her too, after
we get her away from that sort of thing and brush her up,
and get her into the Hunter ways,&#8221; he told himself as he
tied the pony in the dark stall.</p>
<p>The next day was a dream to the young girl, who
patiently watched the clock and waited for the hour of
visiting the new house again. &#8220;I have no higher desire
on earth than to do things for you,&#8221; was the undercurrent
of her thoughts. She was to escape from the things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
which threatened at home. Instead of always rendering
services, which were seldom satisfactory after she had
sacrificed herself to them, she was to be served as well.
Oh, the glad thought! Not of service as such, but of the
mutuality of it. She loved John Hunter and he loved
her. There was to be understanding between them.
That was the joy of it. To put her hand on the arm of
one that appreciated not only her but all that she aimed
at, to open her heart to him, to be one with him in aspiration,
that was the point of value which Elizabeth Farnshaw
never doubted was to be the leading characteristic
of their life together.</p>
<p>Now that she was engaged, Elizabeth felt herself emancipated
from home authority. She would belong to herself
hereafter. She would stay with Aunt Susan till she
had her sewing done for the winter at Topeka. She would
go to school only one year, just enough to polish up on
social ideas and matters of dress. Elizabeth Farnshaw
knew that both John Hunter and his mother were critical
upon those accomplishments and her pride told her to
prepare for the mother&#8217;s inspection. She knew that she
was considered a country girl by those of superior advantages,
and she was resolved to show what could be done in
a year in the way of improvement; then she would come
home and teach for money with which to buy her wedding
outfit, and then they would be married. Two years and
the certainty of graduation would have suited her better,
but two years was a long time. The picture of John without
her, and the home he was building for her, planted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
themselves in the foreground of her thoughts, and Elizabeth
was unselfish. She would not make John Hunter
wait. She would make that one year at Topeka equal to
two in the intensity of its living. She would remain away
the shortest possible length of time which was required
for her preparation. Elizabeth was glad that John had
his mother to keep house for him, because she did not
want him to be lonesome while she was gone, though she
did not doubt that he would come to Topeka many times
while she was there. Her mind flew off in another direction
at that, and she planned to send him word when there
were good lectures to attend.</p>
<p>&#8220;John likes those things,&#8221; she thought, and was filled
with a new joy at the prospect of their books, and lectures,
and intellectual pursuits. Her plan of teaching in
the high school was abandoned. It was better to be loved
and have a home with John Hunter than to live in Topeka.
The more Elizabeth thought of it the more she was convinced
that her plan was complete. She was glad there
was a month to spare before Mrs. Hunter came. John&#8217;s
mother was the only warning finger on Elizabeth&#8217;s horizon.
She had always been conscious of a note of anxiety in John
Hunter&#8217;s voice and manner whenever he spoke of his
mother coming to Kansas to live, and she found the
anxiety had been transferred to her own mind when she
began to consider her advent into the home John was
building. She had gathered, more from his manner than
anything definitely said, that his mother would not approve
of much that she would be obliged to meet in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
society about them, that she was a social arbiter in a class
of women superior to these simple farmers&#8217; wives, and
that her whole life and thought were of a different and
more desirable sort. When Elizabeth thought of Mrs.
Hunter she unconsciously glanced down at herself, her
simple print dress, her brown hands, and the heavy shoes
which much walking made necessary, and wondered how
she did really appear; and there was a distinct misgiving
in everything where the older woman had to be considered.</p>
<p>John came early that evening. The carpenters had
raised new questions about shelves and doors and Elizabeth
must go over and decide those matters. They
walked over, and it was late before all the simple arrangements
could be decided upon. As they returned they
walked close together in the centre of the deep road so
as to avoid the dew-laden grass on either side. The open
door of Nathan&#8217;s house gave out a hospitable light, but
they were content to saunter slowly, listening to the
harvest crickets which were already chirruping in the
weeds about them, and looking at the lazy red disk of the
moon just peeping above the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall write mother of our engagement to-night,&#8221;
John said after a rather long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t,&#8221; the girl replied, awakened suddenly from a
reverie of a different sort. &#8220;Let&#8217;s keep it a secret for a
while. I haven&#8217;t told Aunt Susan yet, and I don&#8217;t want
to tell her till I go to Topeka. Of course I&#8217;ll have to explain
if you come down there to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Topeka?&#8221; John exclaimed in astonishment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed merrily. &#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it like me to think you knew all about that? I&#8217;m
going to Topeka to school this winter&mdash;and&mdash;and I hope
You&#8217;ll come a lot. We&#8217;ll have awfully good times. Then
I&#8217;ll teach another term and get my wedding clothes and
get them made, and then, John Hunter, I am yours to
have and to hold,&#8221; she ended happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you are going to school again
now that you are going to get married?&#8221; John Hunter
asked with such incredulity that Elizabeth laughed a
little joyous laugh full of girlish amusement, full of love
and anticipation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why of course&mdash;why not? All the more because we
are going to be married. I&#8217;ll want to brush up on lots of
things before I have to live near your mother; and&mdash;and
we&#8217;ll have awfully good times when you come to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, goodness!&#8221; John said irritably. &#8220;I&#8217;d counted on
being married this fall. I simply can&#8217;t wait two years,
and that is all there is about it.&#8221; Elizabeth argued easily
at first, certain that it could be readily arranged,
but John became more and more positive. At last she
became worried.</p>
<p>The harvest crickets were forgotten as the young girl
pressed closer to his side, explaining the necessity, pointing
out that it was to be her last little fling at the education
for which she had planned so long, her timidity where
his mother was concerned, and her desire to enter the
family upon equal social terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all tomfoolery,&#8221; John answered with fixity of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
purpose. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need a thing that you haven&#8217;t
already got&mdash;except,&#8221; he added slowly, &#8220;except what
mother could help you to. But that isn&#8217;t the point. I
shall need you. It&#8217;s time for me to get down to business
and raise some money. Between building the house and
going&#8221;&mdash;John hesitated&mdash;&#8220;and not applying myself as
I should, I&#8217;m not making anything this summer. I want
to get away from this&mdash;from here&mdash;some day, and I
want to begin real work at once. Mother can help you
in anything you don&#8217;t know; she&#8217;s up on all those things;
and we&#8217;ve got to get down to business,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>There was a tone of finality in it. Elizabeth recognized
it, but her plans were made and she was not ready
to give them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go into your house, John, I simply cannot,
without getting away and learning some things. When I
become your wife I want to be a woman you are proud to
take to your mother. I can&#8217;t have it otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was quiet while she waited for the answer to her
assertion. Elizabeth thought he was formulating a reply.
The silence lengthened, and still she waited. They were
getting nearer the house and she moved more slowly, drawing
on his arm to check his advance. At last, realizing
that he did not intend to speak when they were just outside
of the lighted doorstep, Elizabeth stopped and, facing
around so that she could see him in the dim light, asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What have I done to offend you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, only it upsets every plan I have on earth.
I tell you, it&#8217;s all foolishness; and besides, I need you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Now see here&#8221;&mdash;and he went on to show her how his
mother knew all the things she was going to Topeka to
learn, and to outline his schemes for the future.</p>
<p>Confused by his opposition, and not knowing just how
to meet this first difference of opinion, Elizabeth listened
and made no reply. It was her way to wait when disturbed
until she saw her way clear. Elizabeth was sound
and sturdy but not quick and resourceful when attacked.
John talked on till he had finished his argument and then
turned to the house again. When they arrived at the
step he said a whispered good-bye and was gone before
Elizabeth realized that he was not coming in with her.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby had risen from her chair, thinking that
John was coming into the house, and when she saw that
he did not she slipped her arm about the young girl and
kissed her as she was passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed, Aunt Susan,&#8221; Elizabeth said, and
passed on to the door of her own room. Susan Hornby
knew that something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Saturday morning was spent by Elizabeth sewing on
a dress she was anxious to finish before Mrs. Hunter came,
and when there were only mornings and evenings in which
to sew, and inexperience made much ripping necessary,
the work did not progress rapidly. As she sewed she
considered. No, she would not give up the year away at
school. It was absolutely essential that she come into
the Hunter family equipped and ready to assume the
rôle which a wife should play in it. She would be married
without a whole new outfit of clothes, but the year at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
school was a necessity. Elizabeth&#8217;s pride revolted against
being taught social customs by John Hunter&#8217;s mother.
As she thought of the year he must spend alone, however,
she was quite willing to give up teaching an extra year for
the sake of the usual bridal finery. She resolved to tell
him that. She would be married in the simplest thing she
had if he wished.</p>
<p>Fate in the person of John Hunter himself took the
settlement of the bride&#8217;s gown out of Elizabeth&#8217;s hands.
Just before noon he stopped, on his way back from Colebyville,
to give Susan Hornby the mail he had brought
out from the post-office. Elizabeth followed him to the
wagon when he went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wrote mother. Can you be ready by October?&#8221;
He spoke across the backs of the horses as he untied
them, and was very busy with the straps.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Farnshaw&#8217;s face contracted visibly. He had
taken advantage of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you do it?&#8221; she asked indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought it was settled! I told you I couldn&#8217;t
wait a whole year, much less two. I told you about getting
Mitchell County land and getting down to cattle
raising right off. You didn&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was such righteous innocence in his voice that
the sting of deception was drawn from her mind. The
young girl made no reply, but leaned her head against
the withers of the horse at her side and looked down at
her foot to hide her tears. It was a blow. She was conscious
that somehow there had been a lack of high principle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
in it. Her silence the night before <i>had</i> given some
colour to the claim of it having been settled, but there had
been a haste about this letter which was suspicious. Why
could he not have stopped on the way to town as well as
now on the way home?</p>
<p>The question which was forming in Elizabeth&#8217;s mind
was cut short by feeling John&#8217;s arm stealing around her.
She started and glanced at the house apprehensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they can&#8217;t see us,&#8221; John said, glad to have that
phase of the situation up for argument. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
matter if they did, since we are to be married so soon.&#8221;
He added the last warily and watched to see its effect upon
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t want it to be as soon as that,&#8221; the girl
objected half-heartedly, making her usual mistake of
laying the vital point of difference away to be settled in
her own mind before she discussed it. Perhaps after all
John had thought it was settled the night before; at any
rate she would not speak of her suspicion till sure on that
point.</p>
<p>John Hunter noticed that she did not refuse outright
to consent to the early marriage and drew her complacently
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t wait that long, sweet. I want you and I
want you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her close, in a firm, insistent grasp of his strong
arm. Her resistance began to melt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; his voice said close to her ear. She felt
his eyes seeking hers. His was the position of advantage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Elizabeth loved love, and she had never had it before.
She had never been wanted for love&#8217;s sake. She wished
to believe him. It came over her that she had wronged
him by even the thought of an advantage having been
taken of her. John&#8217;s arm was about her, he was pleading
his love. Why be unpleasant about it? It was only a
little thing. As she had said in her engagement hour,
Elizabeth wanted love till she could die for it. She gave
up, though something in her held back and was left
hungry.</p>
<p>As John Hunter drove home to Liza Ann&#8217;s waiting
dinner he said to himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! but I&#8217;m glad I got that letter off. I knew
I&#8217;d better do it this morning or she&#8217;d be hanging back.
It worked better than I had any reason to expect. She&#8217;s
going to be easy to manage. Mother ain&#8217;t able to cook
for hired men. She&#8217;s never had it to do&mdash;and she don&#8217;t
have to begin. This school business is all foolishness,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not stand as usual and watch her lover
drive toward home. Something in her wanted to run
away, to cry out, to forget. She was torn by some indefinable
thing; her confidence had received a shock. She
went back to the house, but to sew was impossible now.
She decided to go home, to walk. The long stretches of
country road would give time and isolation in which to
think. She announced her determination briefly as she
passed through the kitchen, oblivious of Aunt Susan&#8217;s
questioning eyes. Snatching up the large sunbonnet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
which was supposed to protect her from the browning
effects of Kansas winds and sun, she told the older woman,
who made no effort to disguise her astonishment at the
sudden change, to tell John to come for her on the morrow,
and set off toward the north.</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew that her father&#8217;s temper made her
homegoing an unsafe procedure, but the tumult within
her demanded that she get away from Susan Hornby and
think her own thoughts unobserved.</p>
<p>But though the walk gave her time to think, Elizabeth
was no nearer a decision when she sighted the Farnshaw
cottonwoods than she had been when she started out.
The sun burned her shoulders where the calico dress was
thin, and she wiped her perspiring face as she stopped
determinedly to come to some conclusion before she should
encounter her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to give up to him,&#8221; she said, watching
a furry-legged bumblebee as it moved about over the
face of a yellow rosin weed flower by the roadside. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t care if it weren&#8217;t for his mother. I&#8217;d like to get
some of these country ways worked out of me before I
have to see too much of her. She&#8217;ll never feel the same
toward me if she has to tell me what to do and what not
to do. If only he didn&#8217;t want me so badly. If only I
could have one year away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new house pleaded for John Hunter, the content of
a home, life with the young man himself. Elizabeth had
reasoned away her distrust of the means by which her
consent had been gained, but her heart clung to the desire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
to appear well before Mrs. Hunter. Something warned
her that she must enter that house on an equal footing
with the older woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he wants me, and I ought to be glad he is in a
hurry. I&#8217;ll do it. I ought to have insisted last night if
I meant to hold out, and not have let him misunderstand
me. If it weren&#8217;t for his mother, I wouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having decided to accept the terms offered her, Elizabeth
sat down in the shade of a clump of weeds and
pictured, as she rested, the home which was to be hers.
Compared to those of the farmers&#8217; wives about them, it was
to be sumptuous. She thought of its size, its arrangement,
and the man who was inviting her to share it with him,
and a glad little thrill ran through her. When Elizabeth
began to sum up her blessings she began to be ashamed
of having suspected John Hunter of duplicity in writing
the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me he had no higher desires on earth than to
do things for me,&#8221; she said, springing up and starting home
with a song in her heart.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw, called to the door by the barking of the
dogs, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;What in this world brings you home at this time of
day?&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s hands were covered with the
dough of her belated Saturday&#8217;s baking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just had to come, mummie; just had to come,&#8221; Elizabeth
cried, giving her mother a rapturous little hug.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw ducked her head to avoid the man&oelig;uvre,
saying petulantly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m in th&#8217; flour up t&#8217; my
elbows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth flicked her dress sleeve and laughed in merry
derision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kansas flour brushes off easily, ma,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ve got something to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corners of Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s mouth twitched in a
pleased effort to cover a smile.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was surprised at her own statement. She
had not exactly intended to tell her mother at this time
and could not understand herself in having put the idea
forth, that she had come all the way home to tell something
of importance. She sat down and leaned her elbows on
the littered kitchen table too confused to speak for a
moment. She had made the plunge; there was no other
excuse for the trip that she could think of at that time,
and, with a feeling that Aunt Susan had been defrauded of
something distinctly belonging to her, Elizabeth broke
the silence with the bald statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hunter and I are going to be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Lizzie, that ain&#8217;t much news; we seen it comin&#8217;
weeks ago,&#8221; the mother replied with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did? I don&#8217;t see how you knew,&#8221; the girl said,
startled out of her confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he been comin&#8217; here so steady for?&#8221;
Mrs. Farnshaw replied, scraping the side of her bread
pan with a kitchen knife, and ready to enter into this
delightful bit of argument. Lizzie was doing well for
herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of girls have steady company and don&#8217;t get married
either,&#8221; the girl replied hesitantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, but this is different,&#8221; the mother said.
&#8220;When&#8217;s it goin&#8217; t&#8217; be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some time in October,&#8221; Elizabeth said, her words
dragging. She had consented, but the mere mention of
the time made her shrink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is th&#8217; house done?&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw asked, her mind,
like her hands, filled with practical concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost,&#8221; Elizabeth returned as she rose to get the
broom with which to sweep the ever dusty floor. &#8220;It&#8217;s
ready to paint,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it goin&#8217; t&#8217; be painted? Will it be white and have
green shutters?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed at the gratified pride in her mother&#8217;s
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, ma,&#8221; she said, looking for the shovel,
which, when it could be located, served as a dustpan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he ask you what colour to put on it?&#8221; the
mother asked, fishing the shovel out of the rubbish collected
behind the rusty cook stove. &#8220;Now look here,
Lizzie,&#8221; she added with sudden suspicion, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
go an&#8217; spoil him right t&#8217; begin with. You let him see that
you want things your own way about th&#8217; house. If you
set your foot down now, You&#8217;ll have it easier all th&#8217; way
through. That&#8217;s where I made my mistake. I liked t&#8217;
give up t&#8217; your pa at first an&#8217; then&mdash;an&#8217; then he got t&#8217;
thinkin&#8217; I didn&#8217;t have no right t&#8217; want anything my
way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw filled the hungry stove with cobs and
studied the subject dejectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get my way about nothin&#8217;. I can&#8217;t go t&#8217; town
t&#8217; pick out a new dress that is bought with money I get
from th&#8217; eggs, even. He&#8217;ll manage most any way t&#8217; get
off t&#8217; town so&#8217;s t&#8217; keep me from knowin&#8217; he&#8217;s goin&#8217;, an&#8217;
then make me send th&#8217; eggs an&#8217; butter by some one that&#8217;s
goin&#8217; by. He makes me stay home t&#8217; watch something
if he has t&#8217; let me know he&#8217;s goin&#8217; his self. I don&#8217;t own
my house, nor my children, nor myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The undercurrent of Elizabeth&#8217;s thoughts as she listened
to the spiritless tale was, &#8220;but John&#8217;s so different from
pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll never have no help from you now,&#8221; Mrs.
Farnshaw continued in the same whine.</p>
<p>The girl crossed the room and put her arms tenderly
around her mother&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll live real near you, ma, and you can come and see
me every few days. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s spoil these last few weeks
by worrying,&#8221; Elizabeth said, her eyes opened to the
longing expressed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw was heating the oven for baking, and
broke away from the sympathetic clasp to refill the roaring
stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;These cobs don&#8217;t last a minute,&#8221; she said, and then
turned to Elizabeth again. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have th&#8217; nicest house
in th&#8217; country. My! won&#8217;t it make th&#8217; Cranes jealous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t count,&#8221; Elizabeth answered. &#8220;I believe
you think more of John&#8217;s house than you do of him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m glad t&#8217; see you doin&#8217; so well for
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she finished speaking, Mr. Farnshaw came into the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pa, how do you do?&#8221; Elizabeth said, turning
toward him pleasantly. She wanted to tell him of her
engagement, now that she had told her mother, and she
wanted to be at peace with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw mumbled a curt reply and, picking up
the empty basket standing beside the stove, went out of
the house, slamming the door behind him significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell him myself,&#8221; Elizabeth said with a
half-shamed look in her mother&#8217;s direction. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
all men aren&#8217;t like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he remembers that awful thing you said about
partin&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw began.</p>
<p>&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t any new thing in him, ma. He&#8217;s always
been that way,&#8221; Elizabeth objected, determined not to let
her mother start on that subject to-day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know it! They all get that way if they&#8217;re let;
think they own everything in sight. They get worse, too,
as they get older. You do what I said an&#8217; set your foot
down about that house,&#8221; her mother replied, and turned
to put a pan of bread in the oven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ERASING HER BLACKBOARD</h3>
</div>

<p>John&#8217;s attention centred about the new house and
each day found him more impatient to see it finished.
The creature comforts of life were his
main ideals and he wanted to get settled. Sunday
afternoon found him early at Nathan&#8217;s to consult with
Elizabeth about the kitchen windows. Susan Hornby&#8217;s
surprised recognition of his annoyance, when he was told
that she had gone home, added to the unpleasantness of
the eight-mile drive. What business had that woman
studying him or his moods? he asked himself as he drove
away. He would not get out of the wagon when he reached
Elizabeth&#8217;s home, though the sun was hot and Mrs. Farnshaw
urged him to do so. He was irritated, he did not
know at what, but he was. He hurried Elizabeth away
without ceremony. As soon as they were beyond earshot
he began to voice his grievances. The point he discussed
had nothing whatever to do with the real ground
for his irritability, but served as an outlet for his acrid
frame of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to go anywhere, let me know it so that I
can take you. I can&#8217;t have you running around the country
in this fashion,&#8221; he began.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth, who had felt his manner, looked up in puzzled
surprise. She could see nothing in that to be fretted
about. It was so good to see him, to have him with her
again after a night spent in her father&#8217;s house, that she
was ready to concede any point her lover might raise, but
this seemed so trivial that she laughed a happy laugh as
she answered caressingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always walked whenever and wherever I chose
around here. I like it, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t make any difference; it ain&#8217;t good for any
woman to walk eight miles at one time,&#8221; John answered
shortly.</p>
<p>Unable to see the reason for laying stress upon the
danger in doing a thing she had done for years without
harm to herself, Elizabeth was surprised into continuing
the argument without at all caring whether she ever
walked again or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve walked that much a hundred times in my life,
and I&#8217;ll probably walk it a hundred times more,&#8221; she replied
with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you live with me,&#8221; John Hunter announced, standing
as solid as a rock on the issue now that he had raised it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; the girl inquired, still but little concerned,
and looking her betrothed over with a girl&#8217;s eye
for correct combinations of collar, tie, and driving gloves.
Those gloves had been the chief objection Elizabeth&#8217;s
brothers had been able to raise against the Eastern man,
and gave colour to the spiteful &#8220;dude&#8221; with which John
Hunter was mentioned by the envious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; John repeated after her. &#8220;Because it
don&#8217;t look well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ridiculous and inadequate reply drew the girl still
deeper into the discussion. She began to reason with him
quite earnestly. She had always walked a great deal; she
loved it. Walking was jolly fun. Everybody knew she
was not as dependent upon being taken as the ordinary
woman. When, however, John would not give in and
insisted that things were different now that they were
engaged, she ceased to say more.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;people expect me to take
you. They&#8217;ll think something&#8217;s happened and that I
don&#8217;t want to. If I want to take my future wife, she
ought to be willing to be taken. I don&#8217;t want you ever
to walk home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Farnshaw was young, the experiences of her
night at home had made her covet peace, she was unaware
that she was being moulded, or that her lover considered
the Hunter ways, as such, especially desirable. Willing
to pay the price, rather enjoying the masterful way in
which her betrothed insisted upon serving her, reflecting
that no one had ever been willing to serve her at all, and
feeling that it was a minor matter, she gave up.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! I like to walk, but if you look at it in that
way I won&#8217;t do it again,&#8221; she promised, and in the silence
which followed stole a look now and then at John Hunter,
revelling in his well-groomed appearance. A vision of her
father&#8217;s slatternly, one-suspendered shoulders, and button-less
sleeves flapping about his rough brown wrists, set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
against this well-shirted gentleman produced sharp contrast
and made of the future a thing altogether desirable.
The useless arguments between her parents arose before
her also; she resolved to argue less and love more. It was
something, she reflected, to know when to lay an argument
down. Besides, John wanted it. Leaning over, she
rubbed her cheek softly against his sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought I could be so happy.&#8221; The words
were whispered tenderly, as she looked up into his face.</p>
<p>Could mortal man fail to appreciate the manner of the
surrender? There was nothing left to argue about; all
had been granted. Elizabeth was learning, as all women
have had to do before her, that the man-creature loves to
be adored, that by cloaking her own desires, stroking his
fur the right way, giving it little pats of approval and
admitting the pleasure conferred by his presence, she
could work a magic. John&#8217;s arm dropped about her and
she gave herself up to the delights of being cuddled.</p>
<p>It was not possible for the inexperienced girl to measure
the importance of the freedom she had surrendered.
Elizabeth desired to forget the unpleasant things. Real
issues were obscured for the girl by her desire to escape
from her father&#8217;s house. In addition to that, Elizabeth
had not yet become analytical. Instead of meditating
upon the manner or the positiveness of her lover&#8217;s commands,
she took counsel with herself how to make their
lives different from her parents&#8217;, and in her efforts to keep
her own attitude right forgot to see to it that there was a
similar attitude on the part of her future husband.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>As they drove along with John&#8217;s arm about her they
ceased to talk, and Elizabeth&#8217;s thoughts drifted off to her
affairs with her father and the night just spent at home.
Mr. Farnshaw had adopted the policy of contemptuous
silence toward her, and Elizabeth hoped devoutly that he
would continue in that frame of mind. Only so would she
dare to spend at home the weeks between the close of
school and her marriage. She had counted much upon
spending those weeks with Aunt Susan, who daily became
dearer. She was not moved to tell Aunt Susan girlish
secrets, but she was understood and rightly valued in
Susan Hornby&#8217;s home; and now, during this one of all the
critical periods in her life the most important, Elizabeth
desired to be with her, but Mrs. Farnshaw demanded uncompromisingly
that her daughter come home at that time.
There was no escaping Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s demands on her
children, and, troubled and uncertain, Elizabeth pondered
and snuggled closer to the man who was to deliver her
from them.</p>
<p>The pair drove to the new house before going to the
Hornbys&#8217; for the rest of the day. John ceased to be fretful,
and by the time for leaving had arrived, Elizabeth had
forgotten that he had ever been so. That evening Aunt
Susan was told of the engagement, and having divined
its arrival, she was able to hide any misgivings she had
about it. Besides, not having anything upon which to
fasten her objections to John Hunter, she was wise enough
to know that love must have its way, and when Elizabeth
pictured the life that awaited her, her lover&#8217;s good points,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and her satisfaction rang out in a song of glad notes with
no hint of apprehension, the older woman tried to enter
into the spirit of the hour.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was certain she could meet John Hunter&#8217;s
moods as the occasion required. No doubts assailed her
about the future life except where John&#8217;s mother was concerned.
When Elizabeth got to that point in her reflections
she stopped short without speaking of the matter
and announced her intention of going to bed. Elizabeth
Farnshaw loved John Hunter devotedly, but his mother
was another matter. There was a strong undercurrent of
anxiety whenever Mrs. Hunter had to be considered. The
nearer the time came for her arrival, the more the girl
dreaded meeting her. Elizabeth was loyal to John, however,
and Susan Hornby was given no hint of that dread.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter came west the last week of school, and
when John was so busy getting her and her household
goods settled that Elizabeth did not see him the entire
week, it was like a stab to the sensitive girl. Filled with a
natural sense of good-byes to all that she had known and
loved in the work, the impending changes in her life took
on a troubled air when John failed to come as usual and
did not account for the delay. By some psychological
process Susan Hornby&#8217;s misgivings began to be transferred
to Elizabeth&#8217;s mind. Always as they sewed together
Elizabeth was tempted to talk about the subject,
but something held her back. Often Susan Hornby, who
suspected her troubled state of mind, was moved to ask
questions and could not.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>A week is a long time when anxiety governs the thoughts,
and as Elizabeth grew more lonely she crept into Aunt
Susan&#8217;s arms as well as into her heart. It became her
custom to creep up to the older woman after the lamps
were lighted and lay her head in her lap, while she would
imprison one of Aunt Susan&#8217;s hands so as to be able to
fondle it. The evidences of affection became more and
more a part of her thoughts now that the days were slipping
by without receiving those evidences from the one
who had educated her in them.</p>
<p>The last day of school arrived. John had told Elizabeth
the week before that he expected to take her and her
trunk home, but not having seen him nor had a word from
him recently regarding the matter, a strange feeling of
disaster made the closing school exercises unreal and uninteresting.
After the children were gone, Elizabeth began
the task of cleaning the schoolroom and putting it in
order. She set about the work slowly, making it last as
long as she could. School teaching had been pleasant
work. It had been the one free field of action life had ever
granted her, the one point where she had ever possessed
herself and moved unquestioned. The presence of John
Hunter&#8217;s mother in the community had made the
teaching seem a refuge to the young girl who was to
live in the house with her. Elizabeth had not understood
that Mrs. Hunter was actually to live with them
till a short time before her arrival, and then had very
nearly given offence to her lover by an astonished exclamation
of surprise. Perceiving that she had done so she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
hastened to say that she would be very glad to have his
mother with them. As soon as Elizabeth had got away,
and taken time to think it out, she saw that she had lied.
John also knew that it was not exactly true, and was therefore
more sensitive. It had been the first point of real
difference between them. There had been no discussion
of it. Elizabeth would have been glad to go to him and
say that she wished it, but she did not wish it and would
not lie consciously. If it had to be, she would make the
best of it and make his mother as welcome as she could,
but with the instincts of all young things, the girl wanted
to live alone with her mate. The unnaturalness of having
others thrust upon them during that first year of married
life jarred upon her, just as it has jarred upon every bride
who has been compelled to endure it since the beginning of
time. It made of the new home a workshop instead of a
nest, and took from the glamour of marriage. It made
the girl cling to the freedom of the country schoolhouse
and fear the new life, where the examples presented to her
by those who had tried it were discouraging to an observant
onlooker. All this came up as she worked, and saddened
the day even more than before. As she put the
broom away in the corner beside the water pail, she noticed
that the blackboard remained to be cleaned. Taking an
eraser she rubbed vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a rat. Run, rat, run,&#8221; begun as high as little
arms could reach, and straggling zigzagingly down toward
the bottom, was the last to be attacked. As her hand
passed reluctantly over it she said aloud:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m erasing my blackboard too. Pretty soon I won&#8217;t
be a girl any more. Pretty soon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She checked herself, and putting away the eraser,
packed the few belongings in the drawer of the desk into
a neat bundle to be carried home. With the package
under her arm and her little tin dinner pail dangling from
her wrist, Elizabeth fitted the key into the lock. As it
clicked under her fingers the thought came to her that she
must turn it over to the school board. The finality of it
clutched her. Thrusting the key back into the door, she
was about to go into the little room again for another look
around, when Susan Hornby&#8217;s voice at her elbow made
her start.</p>
<p>Aunt Susan saw the tears which had sprung into the
young eyes at the leave-taking and drew her down on the
step.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked earnestly. &#8220;You ought to
tell me if you are worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears which had been gathering spilled themselves
over cheek and chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I get like the rest of them, Aunt Susan?&mdash;never
go anywhere, never read anything, have nothing ahead
but the same weary round over again every day?&#8221; she
queried, when she was able to command her voice.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby&#8217;s face worked determinedly to control
her own emotions for a moment before she could speak.</p>
<p>Elizabeth continued: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been&mdash;I&#8217;ve been so happy
this summer, Aunt Susan, and&mdash;and I&#8217;m a little afraid of
that other life. Don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t want to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
married&mdash;I do,&#8221; she felt bound to interpose. &#8220;It&#8217;s just&mdash;just
that&mdash;well, you can see how it is; the married women
around here wear faded things, and&mdash;and their teeth get
bad&mdash;and a man hardly ever wants to take his wife anywhere.
Look at Mrs. Carter, and Mrs. Crane, and ma.
Poor ma! She never gets to go anywhere she wants to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girlish questionings and fears broke down Susan
Hornby&#8217;s control and she fell on Elizabeth&#8217;s neck and
sobbed openly as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know. I&#8217;ve thought of little else of late.
My poor little ewe lamb! My poor little ewe lamb!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ethics of Susan Hornby&#8217;s generation did not permit
of an outright discussion of the marriage relation. She
did not have the matter clear in her own mind, but a sort
of dull terror came over her whenever she thought of
Elizabeth becoming John Hunter&#8217;s wife. She could hardly
have told why. She knew that somehow human beings
missed the highest in the marriage relation and that the
undiscussed things of life had to do with the failure; she
knew also that her instincts regarding this marriage were
true, but she could sound no warning because her knowledge
came from the instincts and had no outward evidence
of fact with which to support it. To how large a degree
did these warnings apply to all? Susan Hornby had
plenty of time to wonder and think, for Elizabeth cried
softly to herself without speaking further. The older
woman&#8217;s hand wandered over the glossy braids in her lap,
and her eyes wandered off toward the Carter homestead
while her mind struggled with the problems of the neighbourhood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Elizabeth had put into words a thing she had
herself observed. She saw the irritability of men toward
their wives; she saw women about them who toiled earnestly,
who bore children, and who denied themselves every
sort of pleasurable relation at the demand of husbands
who never gave them a look of comradery or good fellowship
in return. Was it the weariness of the struggle to
live, or was it sex, or was it the evil domination of men?
This girl whose sunny hair she was caressing was to go
under the merciless hammer of the matrimonial auctioneer.
What was to be her fate? Susan Hornby saw that love had
touched the highest in Elizabeth Farnshaw&#8217;s nature and
that the girl yearned toward a high ideal of family life.
She had shown it in her girlish chatter as they had sewed
together. Could she attain to it? Susan Hornby thought
of John Hunter and stiffened. She felt that Elizabeth
would yearn toward it all the days of her life with him
and never catch even a fleeting glimpse of it.</p>
<p>Elizabeth snuggled closer on the step and reached for
the hand stroking her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the faded dresses, Aunt Susan; it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s the
faded life I&#8217;m afraid of,&#8221; she whispered thickly.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby bent her head to catch the sobbing voice,
and losing control of her reserve, said abruptly: &#8220;I
know it, I know all about it. If I thought John Hunter&#8217;d
let you set at home like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew while the words were still in her mouth that
it was a mistake. The girl shrank away and dropped the
hand she had been fondling. There was absolute silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
for a moment, the older woman dumb, unable to go on,
unable to explain, unable to retract, or extricate herself in
any way. The discussion had promised so well at first that
both had entered into it with zest, and yet the moment
it had become personal, loyalty had risen between them
and hushed their words and left them uncomfortable.
The silence became so intolerable that Elizabeth arose,
and unable to look up turned and fumbled with the lock
on the schoolhouse door. Aunt Susan rose also and
waited, without speaking, for her to start home. Something
hurt on both sides. Neither blamed the other, but
both were to look back to the rough schoolhouse steps
and the half-hearted discussion of man&#8217;s domination and
woman&#8217;s inability to defend herself against it.</p>
<p>Before supper was quite finished John came to take
Elizabeth to meet his mother. He was all bustle and activity;
in fact, John Hunter was at his best. He took possession
of her in exactly the way to show how unnecessary
her fears had been. The reaction set in. John was fresh
and clean of linen and finger-nails and pleasing to the eye.
Elizabeth&#8217;s mood changed the moment he presented himself
on Nathan&#8217;s doorstep. Every fear of the faded life
disappeared in his magical presence. John Hunter at
least was not faded. After all, Elizabeth had been a bit
piqued and really wanted to meet Mrs. Hunter. John
whisked her off merrily and carried her to the home which
was to be theirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, this is Elizabeth Farnshaw, soon to be your
daughter,&#8221; was the introduction he gave her when his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
mother met them at the door, and then watched narrowly
to see what sort of impression Elizabeth would make.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter kissed the girl gravely, and still retaining
her hand stepped back and looked at her curiously, but
kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you are to be John&#8217;s wife, dear,&#8221; she said
slowly. &#8220;I am sure we shall like each other. We must&mdash;he
is all I have, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who had felt herself on trial, was near tears,
but her lover saved her from that embarrassment when,
feeling that the Hunter approval was accorded, he stepped
forward and put his arms about the two, kissing first one
and then the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother and my wife-to-be must certainly like each
other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They passed into the house, over which John and his
mother conducted Elizabeth, talking of its arrangement
and furnishings. The girl had supposed that she had a
fairly definite idea of the appearance that house would
have, having overseen every feature of its building, but
it was a world of surprises she entered upon to-day. In
her wildest dreams of what they would do when they had
become rich, as they had planned much to do, this daughter
of the Kansas prairies had never pictured such tasteful
home-making. Each bedroom had its bureau with
bedstead to match, and the one downstairs had ruffled
pillow-shams.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is to be your own room,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter whispered
in Elizabeth&#8217;s ear, and the young girl stole a shy look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
her lover, who was drumming on the window and had not
heard, and made no reply, but it gave her a sense of possession
in the new house which she had very nearly lost of
late.</p>
<p>It was reserved for the new cook stove in the spotless
kitchen to complete the surprises of Elizabeth&#8217;s new world.
Elizabeth fingered the nickled knobs, exclaimed over
the reservoir for hot water at its back and the warming
closet below, and investigated all its secret places as if it
had been a toy. John Hunter gave his mother an approving
nod behind the girl&#8217;s back, and the visit was a
success. Elizabeth forgot that she was to share the
honours of the home with &#8220;Mother Hunter,&#8221; as she had
secretly called her a few times, and in the end overstayed
her time till the leave-taking at Aunt Susan&#8217;s had to be cut
short, and they were late in arriving at her father&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>The day, which had had so many variations, however,
like a piece of music, was to return to the original theme
before it closed. It had been a day of forebodings and
anxiety. Fate never permitted Elizabeth Farnshaw more
than a short snatch at happiness, and as John Hunter
drove away after he had helped her deposit her trunk in
a dusty corner, the girl wanted to run after him and implore
him not to leave her at the mercy of the morrow.</p>
<p>As she gazed about the cheerless kitchen she noticed a
muffled lump in the middle of the table. The sponge for
the Saturday&#8217;s baking had been warmly wrapped for the
night. To-morrow would be bake day! Oh, joy! Elizabeth
resolved to insist upon kneading the dough the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
morning, and before starting up the ladder to the loft
where she was to sleep she hunted around in the kitchen
safe for the cook book, wondering if by any chance she
could induce her mother to let her try her hand at baking
a cake also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to bed, in there!&#8221; growled a voice from the other
room, and the girl climbed to her pallet, on which dreams
of cooking were to entertain her waking as well as her
sleeping hours.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s cooking schemes turned out rather better
than she had expected. There are some things common
to all women, and Mrs. Farnshaw entered into her
daughter&#8217;s desire to learn to cater to the appetite of the
man she was going to marry. She worked with the girl
at the home-made kitchen table, and as they worked she
talked of many things which to her mind were essential
to preparations for marriage, of the dresses to be made, of
the new house, which was Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s pride, and of
John Hunter himself. By some unlucky chance Elizabeth
mentioned her father&#8217;s name. Mrs. Farnshaw had
been waiting for an opportunity to speak of the misunderstanding
between her husband and their daughter. It is
the tendency of the weak to waste much time and energy
in reconciliations, and to Mrs. Farnshaw peace meant far
more than principles. She gave little thought to the
rightness of her husband&#8217;s demands, but bent every
faculty toward coaxing her family to accede to them.
If he were angry, all must move in cautious attempt to
placate his temper, and if his feelings were hurt no principle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
must be permitted to stand in the way of excuse and
explanation. She was rejoiced when Elizabeth mentioned
her father&#8217;s name and forced upon her at once the
necessity of asking pardon for the luckless remark regarding
separation which Mr. Farnshaw had overheard three
months before.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t a particle of use, ma,&#8221; Elizabeth replied
when pushed to the point of answering. &#8220;You know he&#8217;ll
hate me now, no matter what I ever do. I&#8217;ve only got
along peaceably this far by not talking to him of anything
at all. It&#8217;s his way. Let it alone. I&#8217;m sorry I ever said
it, but it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it can,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw persisted. &#8220;Anyhow,
he&#8217;s your pa, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; you owe it t&#8217; him. You
owe it t&#8217; me too, t&#8217; make it right. I&#8217;ll never have a day of
peace with him again if you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;d no business t&#8217;
talk of partin&#8217; nohow! &#8217;Taint decent, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; it give
him th&#8217; feelin&#8217; that I was sidin&#8217; in with such talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw had been shrewd enough to save her
strongest point till the last. That was the lever by which
she could pry Elizabeth loose from her seated conviction
that nothing could be done. Those sentiments had been
<i>Elizabeth&#8217;s</i>, not her mother&#8217;s. Something was due the
mother who had been compelled to share the blame for
words as abhorrent to her as they were to the irate husband
who supposed she had instigated them. Elizabeth knew
that her mother would never have a day of peace with the
man in any case, but she knew from her own experience with
him that a remark such as she had made would be used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
to worry her mother and to stir even more bitter accusations
than usual. In her heart she knew that nothing she
could say would change her father&#8217;s feelings or alter his
belief about the matter, but she did feel that her mother
was justified from her own standpoint in making the demand.
As she stirred the cake dough and pondered, she
glanced across the table to the open door of her mother&#8217;s
scantily furnished bedroom opposite. A vision of ruffled
pillow-shams where she was soon to sleep came to her in
strong contrast. The memory of muffled sobs which she
had heard coming from that poverty-stricken couch in the
corner opposite the door was set over against the peaceful
look of the room which was to be hers. She was going
away to be happy: why not do this thing her mother asked
before she went? Elizabeth knew that her attempt at
reconciliation would be fruitless, but she resolved to do the
best she could to leave all possible comfort to the mother
whose portion was sorrow and bread eaten in bitterness
and disappointment. She thought it out slowly. After
pondering a long time, during which Mrs. Farnshaw
studied her but did not speak, Elizabeth delivered her
promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the best I can, ma. I don&#8217;t believe It&#8217;ll do any
good, but it isn&#8217;t fair that you should suffer for a thing you
hate as bad as he does. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about it, and
let me find my own time to do it. I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll do my very
best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushing the cake-bowl away from her, she went around
the table, and taking her mother&#8217;s face between her hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
she stroked the thin hair away from the wasted forehead,
and kissed her with a tenderness which brought a quiver to
the unsatisfied lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it as well as I possibly know how. I&mdash;I&#8217;m
going away to be happy, and&mdash;and I want you to be
happy too.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was easier to say than to do, for things went wrong
about the barn, and when supper time arrived Elizabeth
decided to wait for a more propitious time.</p>
<p>In spite of her determination to get the disagreeable
task behind her as soon as possible, Elizabeth could find
no chance at the breakfast table the next morning to
broach the subject, though she tried several times. Mrs.
Farnshaw gave her warning looks, but it was clearly not
the time. When at last the family was ready for divine
services and Mr. Farnshaw drove up in front of the house
with the lumber wagon, the mother gave Elizabeth a little
push toward the door, admonishing her to &#8220;be quick
about it. Now&#8217;s your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth went slowly out. Mr. Farnshaw had just
jumped out of the wagon and when he saw his daughter
coming stooped quickly to examine the leather shoe sole
which served to protect the brake. The elaborate attempt
to ignore her presence made the hard duty still
harder. She waited for him to take cognizance of her
presence, and to cover her confusion adjusted and readjusted
a strap on Patsie&#8217;s harness, thankful for the presence
of her favourite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let that harness alone!&#8221; her father commanded when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
he was at last embarrassed by his prolonged inspection
of the wagon-brake.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, pa,&#8221; Elizabeth replied, glad to have the
silence broken in any manner. &#8220;I&mdash;I came out to talk
to you. If I&mdash;if I&#8217;ve done anything to annoy you, ever,
I want to ask your pardon. I&mdash;ma&mdash;I want to tell you
that John Hunter and I are to be married this fall, and&mdash;and
I&#8217;d like to be the kind of friends we ought to be
before I go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last sounded rather good to the girl and she
stopped, encouraged, also feeling that it was best to let
well enough alone; but when she looked up at him and
encountered his look she shrank as if to avoid something
aimed at her.</p>
<p>The tyrant detests anything which cringes before him,
and Josiah Farnshaw was as much fired to anger by what
he saw in his daughter&#8217;s face as he could have been by
her defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know you&#8217;d like to be friends!&#8221; he sneered with
the fierce hatred of a man caught in an evil act. &#8220;Now
that you&#8217;re goin&#8217; away you&#8217;d like t&#8217; be on good terms with
me, would you? How many cows would you like for
your peaceable intentions? What&#8217;s th&#8217; price of your
friendship, anyhow? Of course you don&#8217;t owe me anything!
You&#8217;re a lady! Now that you&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; set up
housekeepin&#8217; you&#8217;d like t&#8217; be good friends. You&#8217;ll get
nothin&#8217; from me; I&#8217;ll let you know that right here and now.
Go along with you; I don&#8217;t want nothin&#8217; from you, an&#8217; I
don&#8217;t propose t&#8217; give nothin&#8217; to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>It was so coarse, so brutal, so untrue, that the girl met
him once in his life as he deserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your cows,&#8221; she said in the low tones of concentrated
bitterness. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them, nor money from
you. I don&#8217;t owe you anything, either. I&#8217;ve done more
work and furnished you more money than ever I cost you
since the day I was born. I knew no one could explain
anything to you. I told ma so, but she&#8217;s afraid for her
life of you, and insisted. I&#8217;ve tried to keep the peace with
you, really, but no one ever has or ever will be able to do
that. I&#8217;ll let you alone after this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You damned huzzy!&#8221; the now thoroughly aroused
man exclaimed, lunging forward to strike her with his open
hand. He had only listened to her so far because there
had been something so compelling in the rush of her words
that he had been stupefied by astonishment into doing so.</p>
<p>Patsie, who was in line with the blow, reared and threw
herself against her mate, knowing what that tone of her
master&#8217;s voice indicated, and his hands were so occupied
for a few seconds in quieting the team that he could not
follow his daughter and administer the chastisement he
wished.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thrash you within an inch of your life!&#8221; he cried,
however, when he saw her disappearing through the open
door of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, and what have you done?&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw demanded
when the breathless girl pushed rapidly past her at the
inner door and faced about defiantly in the middle of the
kitchen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear another word about it, ever. I&#8217;ve
done it about as bad as I could, I guess, but I&#8217;ll never take
another whipping from him, and you needn&#8217;t expect it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it the way it sounded,&#8221; she moaned after
the family had gone, referring to the figurative speech,
&#8220;She&#8217;s afraid for her life of you.&#8221; That had been meant
in a very different sense. The girl would have given much
to have unsaid it, to have given any sort of explanation.</p>
<p>It was not possible to explain anything to Josiah Farnshaw,
and remembering the threat to flog her as soon as
he returned from meeting, Elizabeth began to put up her
hair and prepare for the departure which was her only way
of escape. Josiah Farnshaw never forgot a promise of
that sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to Aunt Susan&#8217;s,&#8221; she resolved, and as soon as
she could get her dress changed and a few things thrown
quickly into the trunk which she had partially unpacked
the day before, Elizabeth took her parasol and started
toward the south. John lived in that direction also, and
would be on his way to see her, for his mother had asked
Elizabeth to spend the day with her. She would ask John
to come for her trunk and then have him take her to Susan
Hornby&#8217;s house. Aunt Susan would welcome her with
open arms. She was covered with perspiration when she
met her lover, who was hot and uncomfortable also, and
had been cursing every mile of the shadeless Kansas road.
John&#8217;s relief was so great at meeting her a couple of miles
on the way that he did not inquire why she was there at
that hour till she was seated beside him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But your father can&#8217;t do anything to you,&#8221; he objected
when she had outlined her plan of going to Aunt Susan&#8217;s
to stay till the wedding. &#8220;Everybody knows that you
have left there and You&#8217;ll have to explain things and get
into a scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without going into details, Elizabeth insisted that he
drive on at once and get her trunk before her father and
the family should get home from church.</p>
<p>John Hunter argued the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you leave home,&#8221; he said slowly, refusing to
drive on, &#8220;people will talk, and it isn&#8217;t to be considered.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Should she explain the case fully?
It could not be done. John could not be made to
understand. Elizabeth knew that even in the primitive
community in which she had been brought up
a man would be filled with disgust at the idea of
striking a full-grown woman on any sort of provocation,
and that a man reared as John Hunter had been
reared would be alienated not only from her family but
from her.</p>
<p>Caught like a rat in a trap, Elizabeth Farnshaw let her
future husband study her curiously, while she deliberated
and cast about for some means of getting his approval to
her scheme without villifying her parents by telling the
whole truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be nearer you, and Aunt Susan&#8217;s always glad to
have me,&#8221; she said coaxingly.</p>
<p>It was a good bit of argument to put forth at that
moment. The sun poured his heat out upon them in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
scalding fierceness, and John Hunter had cursed his luck
every mile he had covered that morning. He had been
accustomed to reach her in fifteen minutes, and the suggestion
that she go back to the old place began to look
more reasonable, yet he hesitated and was reluctant to
let a breath of gossip touch his future wife. Whether
Elizabeth were right or wrong did not enter into his
calculations.</p>
<p>It looked as if his consent was not to be obtained. She
could not go back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going home, and that is all that there is about
it,&#8221; the girl announced in desperation.</p>
<p>John still hung back.</p>
<p>When he did not reply and it became necessary for her
to go into the details she had been trying to avoid, it was
done reluctantly and with as little emphasis put upon the
possibility of physical chastisement as could be done and
convince him at all. To Elizabeth&#8217;s surprise John did
not take much notice of that element. It did not occur to
her at that time that it was a strange thing that her lover
should fail to be stirred by the probability of her receiving
a blow. Elizabeth had never had consideration
shown her by any one but Susan Hornby and had not
yet learned to expect it. John struck the horses
with the dangling lines he held and drove on toward
the waiting trunk. She watched him as he rode by
her side moodily thinking of the gossip threatened, and
while it was not the mood she wished him to entertain,
it did not occur to her that it was anything but a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
natural one. They rode without speaking until the house
was reached.</p>
<p>&#8220;This&#8217;ll have to be explained to mother,&#8221; he remarked
discontentedly as he shoved the unoffending trunk into
the back of the wagon. Elizabeth made no reply. She
had been thinking of that very thing.</p>

<p>Susan Hornby asked no questions when Elizabeth
and John presented themselves at her door.
Their embarrassed faces warned her. She gathered
Elizabeth into her arms for a brief hug, and then pushed
her toward the inside of the house, remaining behind to
show John where to put the trunk. When it had been set
beside the kitchen door she dismissed him by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t ask you to stay for a bite of dinner, since your
mother is alone, Mr. Hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;mother expected Elizabeth
over there,&#8221; John stammered, looking toward the front
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell your mother Elizabeth will stay right here till
she has rested up from that headache,&#8221; the woman replied
with the tone of having settled the matter.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, in the other room, noted that he did not
argue about it and heard him drive away with mixed feelings.
When at last Aunt Susan&#8217;s questions were answered
the girl in turn became questioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she think&mdash;John&#8217;s mother&mdash;that we&#8217;re coarse
and common?&#8221; she asked when she had told as much as
she could bring herself to tell of the morning&#8217;s altercation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>The look on the older woman&#8217;s face was not a hopeful
one, and the girl got up restlessly from the trunk-top where
she had dropped beside her. She remembered the fear,
half expressed, on the schoolhouse steps two days before
and drew within herself, sick with life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I put my trunk away?&#8221; she asked, to break the
awkward silence she felt coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the relieved answer, and each took a handle,
carrying the light piece of baggage to the bedroom. At
the door Elizabeth stopped short. A strange coat and
vest were spread carelessly over the bed, and a razor strop
lay across the back of the little rocking chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot!&#8221; Susan Hornby exclaimed, sweeping
the offending male attire into her apron. &#8220;A young fellow
stopped last night and asked to stay till he could get
a house built on that land west of Hunter&#8217;s. You&#8217;re going
to have a bachelor for a neighbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, and then added, &#8220;What
will he do for a room if I take this one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Aunt Susan replied to the last clause
of the question. &#8220;The room is yours, anyhow. I&#8217;m so
glad to have you back that I&#8217;d turn him out if need be.
Honestly, we could hardly eat Saturday. Nate was as
bad as I was. They&#8217;ve gone to Colebyville together to-day.
I&#8217;m glad Nate&#8217;s got him&mdash;he&#8217;s lonesome enough
these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Elizabeth&#8217;s turn to cheer up Aunt Susan, for she
always fell into a gloom when she mentioned Nathan. It
took Elizabeth&#8217;s mind from her own affairs, and by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
time the unpacking was finished the volatile spirits of
youth had asserted themselves. They took a walk
toward evening, and only returned in time to meet John
Hunter, who had come to see his betrothed about a trip
he had decided suddenly to take to Mitchell County. He
had spoken of it to Elizabeth before, and had only waited
to get his mother established and a desirable hired man
to run the place in his absence. The man had come that
day asking for work and giving good references and
John had decided to go at once.</p>
<p>In the excitement of preparation John seemed to have
forgotten the discomforts of the morning, and though he
soon took his departure, he left Elizabeth less unhappy
than she had been. Nathan and the new man were coming
in the distance as John Hunter drove away, and the
girl turned back into the kitchen to help with the supper.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Lizzie Farnshaw! And you are the Elizabeth these
folk have been talkin&#8217; about? Well, I&#8217;ll be hornswoggled!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan and the new boarder had just come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really you, Luther?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, and there
was no mistaking the glad tones.</p>
<p>They looked each other over for changes; they sat
beside each other at the table, and Elizabeth asked
questions and talked excitedly while he ate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hair is darker, and it&#8217;s curly,&#8221; she remarked,
remembering the tow-coloured locks cut square across the
boyish, sunburned neck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Luther Hansen&#8217;s face crinkled into fine lines and his
blue-gray eyes laughed amusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got darker as I got older, Lizzie, an&#8217; th&#8217; typhoid put
them girl-twists into th&#8217; ends of it. Bet you&#8217;re a wishin&#8217;
for it&mdash;all th&#8217; women folks do. Wish you had it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went for a walk after supper and talked of many
things. He was the same Luther, grown older and even
more companionable. Elizabeth learned that both his
parents had died, leaving the then seventeen-year-old
boy a piece of land heavily mortgaged, and with nothing
but a broken down team and a superannuated cow to
raise the debt. By constant labour and self-denial the
boy had lifted the financial load, and then happening to
meet a man who owned this Kansas land had traded, with
the hope that on the cheaper land he could reach out faster
and get a good increase on the original price besides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remembered th&#8217; kind of land it was about here, an&#8217;
didn&#8217;t need t&#8217; come an&#8217; see it first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was goin&#8217;
t&#8217; hunt you up &#8217;fore long, anyhow. I never thought of
these folks a knowin&#8217; you, though, after I got here. Funny,
ain&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m right glad t&#8217; be back t&#8217; you,&#8221; was his frank
confession.</p>
<p>And Elizabeth Farnshaw looked up happily into his
face, meeting his eye squarely and without embarrassment.
It was as natural to have Luther, and to have him say
that he wanted to see her, as it would have been to listen
to the announcement from her brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve so much to tell
you that I hardly know where to begin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>Luther laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hornby thought I&#8217;d be put out about that room,
but I told &#8217;er nothin&#8217; like that&#8217;d bother me if it brought
you t&#8217; th&#8217; house. I&#8217;ve been sleepin&#8217; under th&#8217; wagon all
th&#8217; way down from Minnesoty an&#8217; I can go right on doin&#8217;
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not go far, but wandered back and sat on
Nathan&#8217;s unpainted doorstep while the stars came out,
and Elizabeth forgot all about the trials of the morning,
and told him of her engagement to John Hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to live right next to your farm, Luther, and
you must&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Farnshaw had started to say that he must
know John, and somehow the words got suddenly tangled
in her throat, and the sentence was unfinished for the fraction
of a moment and then ended differently from what
she had intended: &#8220;And I shall be so glad to have you
for a neighbour, and You&#8217;ll marry&mdash;now who will you
marry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther, who had begun to like this new Elizabeth even
better than the girl of six years ago, had his little turn in
the dark shadow of Nathan&#8217;s overhanging roof at the
mention of this love affair, but he swallowed the bitter pill
like a man. The renewed acquaintance had been begun
on friendly lines and through all the days which followed
it was kept rigidly on that ground. He was glad to have
been told frankly and at once of John Hunter&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that Elizabeth had stumbled and
found herself unable to suggest that John and Luther were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
to be friends, she talked to Luther of her plans, her hopes
of becoming a good housekeeper, her efforts at cooking,
and of the sewing she was engaged upon. He learned, in
time, of the disagreements with her father, and was not
surprised, and with him she took up the subject of the
marital relations at home. Luther&#8217;s experience was more
limited than Susan Hornby&#8217;s, but he looked the matter of
personal relations squarely in the face and discussed them
without reserve. There was always something left to be
finished between them, and night after night they walked
or sat together on the doorstep till late. Nathan looked
on disapprovingly, not understanding the bond between
them, but Susan, who heard the girl chatting happily
about her coming marriage, saw that the friendship was
on safe ground and laughed away his fears.</p>
<p>Nathan had found his first friend since his Topeka experience,
and was unwilling to see him come to harm; also,
while Nathan had come to love Elizabeth almost as much
as his own daughter, and to miss her when she was away,
he was uncomfortably aware that she prized a culture
which he did not possess, and was subject to fits of jealousy
and distrust because of it.</p>
<p>Days passed. Elizabeth could not induce herself to
call on her future mother-in-law. The surety that she
was cheapened by reports of her home affairs stung her
consciousness and made it impossible to make the call
which she knew she would certainly give offence by omitting.
This, too, she talked over with Luther, and he
advised her to go at once. Each day she would promise,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and each day she would make excuses to herself and him,
till at last the man&#8217;s sober sense told him it must not be
put off longer.</p>
<p>One evening, after John had been gone two weeks, and
Elizabeth explained the fact of not having gone to see Mrs.
Hunter because of the extreme heat, Luther suggested
that she go over to the &#8220;shanty&#8221; with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot my coat, and it looks as if it&#8217;d rain &#8217;fore
mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I kept th&#8217; harness on th&#8217;
horses, so&#8217;s t&#8217; drive over.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Elizabeth expected, the visit to Mrs. Hunter was the
first subject broached after they started.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; live in th&#8217; house with Mrs. Hunter,
Lizzie&#8221;&mdash;Luther always used the old-fashioned name&mdash;&#8220;an&#8217;
you must be friends with &#8217;er,&#8221; he cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Luther. I&#8217;ll go to-morrow, sure, no matter
what happens,&#8221; the girl promised, her words coming so
slowly that there was no mistaking her reluctance. &#8220;I
just can&#8217;t bear to, but I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther considered at some length.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be lonesome, not knowin&#8217; anybody here,&#8221; he
said with almost equal reluctance. &#8220;I&mdash;I want t&#8217; see
you start in right. You&#8217;ve got t&#8217; live in th&#8217; house with
&#8217;er.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last clause of his argument was not exactly in line
with the impression he wished to produce; in fact, it was
only a weak repetition of what he had begun the argument
with, but somehow, like Elizabeth, that was the main fact
in the case which absorbed his attention. He was dissatisfied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
with it, but could think of no way to state it
better; so to turn the subject to something foreign to the
hated topic, he remarked on a hayfield they were passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them windrows ought t&#8217; &#8217;a&#8217; been shocked up,&#8221; he said,
casting his eye up at the northwest to measure the clouds.
&#8220;Jimminy!&#8221; he exclaimed, slapping the team with the
lines. &#8220;I wonder if I&#8217;ve brought you out here t&#8217; get you
wet?&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced apprehensively at Elizabeth&#8217;s thin print
dress as the startled team jerked the old lumber wagon
over the rough road, and half wished he had not brought
her with him, for the signs were ominous. The breeze,
which had been fitful when they had started, had died
away altogether. Not a breath of air was stirring; even
the birds and crickets were silent.</p>
<p>The storm was gathering rapidly.</p>
<p>They rounded the corner, near his building place, on a
full trot, and plunged into the grove of cottonwoods which
surrounded the &#8220;shanty,&#8221; with a consciousness that if
they were to avoid a wetting, haste was necessary.</p>
<p>The faded coat, which was the object of the journey,
hung on the handle of the windlass at the newly sunk well.
The dried lumps of blue clay heaped themselves about the
new pine curb and the young man stumbled awkwardly
over the sunbaked clods as he reached for his coat. As
he turned back toward the wagon an exclamation of dismay
escaped him. The storm had gathered so rapidly
that the boiling clouds could be plainly seen now above
the tops of the ragged trees which surrounded the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
Instead of waiting to put the coat on, Luther flung it into
the back of the wagon, and, climbing hastily over the hub,
turned the horses and drove them into the open road.
One glance after they were free from the grove was
enough. With a shout, he stood up, urging the horses into
a gallop.</p>
<p>Boiling like smoke from the stack of a rapidly moving
locomotive, the storm bore down upon the level Kansas
prairie. Not a sound was heard except a dull roar from
the north. Urging the horses to their utmost efforts with
voice and threatening gestures, Luther looked back at the
girl on the spring seat reassuringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re makin&#8217; good time, Lizzie,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;but
I&#8217;m afraid You&#8217;ll get th&#8217; starch took out of that purty
dress. I never thought of this when I brought you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth, clinging to the backless spring seat with both
hands, smiled back at him. It was only a storm, and at
best could only soak their clothes and hair; but to Luther
more than that was indicated.</p>
<p>As they rounded the corner and turned toward the
north, a sudden puff of wind jerked the shapeless straw
hat from Luther&#8217;s head and sent it careening dizzily over
the stubs of the hay field at the right. Hats cost money,
and Luther pulled up the galloping horses. Hardly waiting
to see whether Elizabeth caught the lines he flung to
her, he sprang to the ground and gave chase. The hat
rolled flat side down against a windrow and stuck, so that
it looked as if it were to be captured, but before he reached
it the wind, which had now become a steady blow, caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
it, and as the only loose thing of its size to be found, played
tag with its owner. At last he turned back, gasping for
breath and unable to lift his head against the blast.</p>
<p>A fleeting glimpse of Elizabeth standing up in the wagon
was all that he got, for a blinding flash of lightning split the
sky from north to south, followed by a terrific crash of
thunder. Half stunned, he fell into the deep rut of an old
road crossing the hayfield at right angles to his course.</p>
<p>As he arose a moment later, a scene never to be forgotten
met his gaze. One of his horses lay motionless on
the ground, the other was struggling feebly to regain its
feet, and Elizabeth was scrambling wildly out of the wagon.
Rushing to her side, Luther drew her away from the
floundering horse. A gust of rain struck them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you hold his head,&#8221; Luther shouted in her ear,
&#8220;while I get him out of the harness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded, and together they caught the bit
and laid the beast&#8217;s head flat on the ground, where the
girl held it fast by main force while Luther worked at the
straps and buckles.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; he cried, when the name-strap gave way
under his fingers. He flung the neck-yoke over against
the body of the dead horse, and stepped back to free himself
from the dangling lines.</p>
<p>Elizabeth let the horse&#8217;s head loose and jumped back,
still holding to the halter-strap. The frightened animal
bounded to its feet with a neigh of alarm, dragging the
girl out of Luther&#8217;s reach just as a thunderous roar and
utter darkness enveloped them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>What happened, exactly, the man never knew. He
picked himself up, half senseless, some minutes later,
covered with mud, and his clothing half torn from his
body. At first he could not recall where he was; then
seeing the dead horse in the road, and the upturned bed
of the wagon itself, he realized that they had been struck
by a cyclone.</p>
<p>The darkness had whirled away with the retreating
tornado, and a gray light showed the demoralized wagon
overturned by the roadside. The wagon was in painful
evidence, but Elizabeth? Where was Elizabeth? Looking
wildly about in all directions, Luther called her name:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie! Lizzie! God in heaven! What has become
of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He remembered the fate of a girl in Marshall County
which he had heard discussed only last week. That child
had been picked up by one of these whirling devils and her
neck broken against a tree!</p>
<p>With a wild cry, he turned and ran in the direction of
the receding storm, calling her name and looking frantically
on both sides of the path where the cyclone had licked
the ground as clean as a swept floor. He could see nothing
at all of Elizabeth. Realizing at last that he was wasting
his efforts, and that some degree of composure would
assist in the search, Luther stopped and looked about him.</p>
<p>Outside the immediate path of the cyclone, which was
cleared of every movable thing, the hay was tossed and
thrown about as if it had been forked over the ground to
dry itself from the wetting it had had. Hay everywhere,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
but no living thing to be seen. Could it be that Elizabeth
had been carried completely away by the storm, or was she
buried in the hay somewhere?</p>
<p>Unresponsive as all nature to human emotions, the
tumbled grass lay about him, a picture of confusion and
ruin. The futility of human effort was borne in upon
him as he scanned the waste. A pile larger than the surrounding
piles separated itself from the scattered heaps at
last. He regarded it eagerly. Yes! there was a flutter of
wet calico.</p>
<p>Half rejoicing, half terrified at the prospect of what he
might find, Luther Hansen ran and flung himself down on
his knees beside it, dragging at the half-buried form of the
girl in frantic haste. She was doubled together and mixed
with the hay as if, after being picked up with it, she had
been whirled with it many times and then contemptuously
flung aside.</p>
<p>Drawing her out, Luther gathered her into his arms and
listened to her heart beat to make certain that she still
lived.</p>
<p>Though limp and unconscious, Elizabeth Farnshaw was
alive, and Luther drew her up and leaned her loosely rolling
head on his shoulder while he considered what to do.</p>
<p>A sharp, peppering fall of hail struck them. Luther
looked about quickly for shelter. The Kansas prairie
stretched level and bare before him. Not even a bush
presented itself. The size of the hailstones increased.</p>
<p>Elizabeth began to show signs of returning consciousness
and to move feebly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>The hailstones came down like a very avalanche of ice.
It became necessary to interpose his body between her and
the storm. He thought of the coat they had come to obtain,
but that had probably gone with the hat and the
hay and all other things in the route of the hurricane. He
stooped close over her quivering form and let the frozen
pellets fall on his unprotected head. The deluge was
mercifully short, but at the end Luther Hansen was almost
beaten into insensibility.</p>
<p>When the hailstorm was over the rain burst upon them
with renewed fury, and the wind blew as cold as a winter&#8217;s
gale. The chill stung them into activity. Luther got
slowly, to his feet, bracing himself against the blast as he
did so, and also pulled up the now conscious girl. Elizabeth&#8217;s
strength had not returned and she fell back, dragging
him to his knees at her side. The rain ran off her
hair and clothes in streams, and against the storm her
thin cotton dress was of no protection whatever. Luther
urged her to control her shaking limbs and try to walk.
It could only be accomplished by much effort. When at
last she staggered to her feet, he put his arm about her
and with bent head turned to face the rain, which cut like
switches at their faces and cold shoulders, to which the
wet cotton garments clung like part of the very skin itself.</p>
<p>The wind blew a gale. It was almost impossible to
make headway against it. Had it not been for Elizabeth&#8217;s
chilled state Luther would have slipped down in a wagon
rut and waited for the squall to subside, but it was essential
that the girl be got under shelter of some sort At length,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
after struggling and buffeting with the storm for what
seemed an age, alternately resting and then battling up
the road toward home, they turned the corner of the
section from which the Hornby house could be seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Elizabeth gave a frightened scream. Luther,
whose head had been bowed against the wind, looked up
with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; broke from his lips.</p>
<p>Only a twisted pile of débris was to be seen where that
house had stood.</p>
<p>With the impulse to reach it instantly, they started on a
run, hand in hand, but the fierceness of the gale prevented
them. Out of breath before they had gone a dozen yards,
there was nothing to do but stop and recover breath and
start again at a pace more in keeping with their powers.
Impatient and horrified, they struggled ahead, running at
times, stumbling, falling, but not giving up. Terrified by
the thought of they knew not what possible disaster ahead
of them, they at last turned into the little path leading to
the ruined house.</p>
<p>Picking their way over scattered bits of household belongings,
broken boards and shingles, for some distance,
they at last reached the main pile of timbers. The girl&#8217;s
heart sank at the thought of what they might find there,
and she made a gesture of distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no place for you, Lizzie,&#8221; Luther said, quick to
comprehend, and sick with pity for her.</p>
<p>As he spoke, his foot sank between some timbers into a
pile of wet cloth, and thinking that it was a human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
form, he shuddered and fell forward to avoid giving an injury
the nature of which he could only guess.</p>
<p>They dug frantically at the pile, and were relieved to
find that it was only a ragged knot of rainsoaked carpet.
It indicated, however, the possibilities of the moment, and
Luther ceased to urge the now frenzied girl to leave him,
and together they stumbled about in their search. Darkness
was falling rapidly, and they called first the name of
Nathan, and then of his wife, beside themselves because
they could not find even a trace of either to indicate their
fate. Had the storm picked them up as it had done Elizabeth
and carried them out of the wreckage?</p>
<p>Luther stopped and shouted the thought into Elizabeth&#8217;s
ear. The wind dropped for an instant, and they stood
looking about the place as well as the gloom would permit.
The rain fell less noisily also. All at once they heard their
names called from somewhere toward the north. Turning,
they saw, what they had not noticed before, that the
straw sheds and the granary were untouched by the tornado.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Luther! Here, Lizzie!&#8221; came another call from
the granary door.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby, faintly seen, was shouting to them at
the top of his voice. A new dash of rain came, and the
wind redoubled its fury as if vexed with itself for having
carelessly let the wayfarers get a glimpse of the harbour
where it would be unable to do them further harm. With
a glad cry, they ran toward the beckoning figure, and a
second later Elizabeth was lifted by Nathan and Luther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
into the open door of the bin-room, and literally fell across
the shifting grain into Aunt Susan&#8217;s open arms, sobbing
and clinging to her as if fearing that the fierce winds would
snatch her away. The relief was almost too much for the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Susan! Aunt Susan! How could I live without
you?&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby drew the horse blanket with which she
was covered over the shuddering child in her arms, and
patted and soothed her, crying softly for joy as she did so,
for the fears of the last hour had been mutual. The
thought of her darling out in the storm, suffering she knew
not what, had unnerved Susan Hornby, and brought home
to her as nothing else had ever done a realization of the
precious relation between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter! My daughter! My Katy&#8217;s own self!&#8221;
she repeated over and over.</p>
<p>The reaction of fright and cold and wet brought on a
chill which set Elizabeth&#8217;s teeth to chattering audibly.
Aunt Susan was beside herself with worry. Do what she
would, the girl could not control herself. They rubbed
and worked with her for some minutes. Luther was
alarmed and blamed himself for having taken her out in
threatening weather. Elizabeth insisted that no harm
had come to her except a wetting, but could not convince
the others till Nathan had a bright idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! we&#8217;ll scoop these warm oats over you. They&#8217;re
as warm as toast&mdash;havin&#8217; th&#8217; blazin&#8217; sun on th&#8217; roof of this
place all day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>The two men were alert for any signs of the old building
toppling over under the terrific pressure of the wind,
and had kept pretty close to the door; but they moved
over in the direction of the two women, and using their
hands as shovels soon had them well covered with oats.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; Nathan shouted, when Susan had
begged them to desist because of the dust they were raising.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll set you folks a sproutin&#8217; if heat an&#8217; moisture&#8217;s
got anything t&#8217; do with it,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>He pulled some grain sacks out of the empty wheat bin
and advised Luther to wrap them around himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m
some wet, myself,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got warm
ragin&#8217; round here like a gopher. Now tell us how you
folks come t&#8217; get here in all this storm. What&#8217;d you do
with th&#8217; horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>All this had been shouted at the top of his voice, for the
wind rattled and tore at the old building with the noise of
a cannonade, as if determined to wreck even this shelter.
It was not possible to see one&#8217;s hand in the darkness, for
when the door had been pulled shut after the young couple,
the last ray of light was shut out. Besides, night had
fallen now, and the darkness outside was no less dense.</p>
<p>Luther told in as few words as possible of the catastrophe
which had befallen them on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Susan,&#8221; Nathan exclaimed, &#8220;th&#8217; same twister
struck them as struck us! Now don&#8217;t that beat you?
Funny th&#8217; stables didn&#8217;t go, too. That&#8217;s th&#8217; way with
them things&mdash;they go along an&#8217; mow a patch a rod &#8217;r
two wide as clean as a whistle, an&#8217; not touch a thing ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
feet away. Lord man!&#8221; he cried, turning toward Luther
in the dark with a reminiscent giggle, &#8220;you should &#8217;a&#8217; seen
us. Sue saw th&#8217; storm a-comin&#8217;, an&#8217; she run out t&#8217; git th&#8217;
chickens in, an&#8217; nothin&#8217; &#8217;d do &#8217;er when she see th&#8217; way them
clouds was a actin&#8217; but I must come in, too. We didn&#8217;t
even milk! I never see anything come on like it; we
didn&#8217;t hardly have time t&#8217; git th&#8217; winders shut till we could
hear it roarin&#8217;! Lord, you should &#8217;a&#8217; heard it come! All
at onct it got dark, an&#8217; th&#8217; house begun t&#8217; rock; an&#8217; then it
slid along on th&#8217; ground, an&#8217; then it lifted clear up at th&#8217;
northeast corner, an&#8217; we slid down in a heap on th&#8217; other
side along o&#8217; th&#8217; cupboards an&#8217; th&#8217; kitchen table an&#8217; crocks
we&#8217;d set out for th&#8217; milk we didn&#8217;t get into &#8217;em, an&#8217; then
th&#8217; house lit over on th&#8217; other corner an&#8217; went t&#8217; pieces
like a dry-goods box. That kitchen table was th&#8217; savin&#8217;
of us! I don&#8217;t know how it got over us, but there it was
with th&#8217; safe an&#8217; water-bench a holdin&#8217; th&#8217; timbers off&#8217;n
us.&#8221; Nathan wound up his story in a lowered tone, and
there was silence for a moment as each went over his personal
experience in thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gittin&#8217; warm there, Elizabeth?&#8221; he asked after a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; the girl answered, still shivering, but with
less audible chattering of her teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right in half an hour,&#8221; Nathan said
with a relieved sigh. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll put a little more of
these oats over you for good luck,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>They heaped the warm grain thick about her, and then,
because it was hard to converse with the noise of the roaring
wind outside, gave up the effort. The old granary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
had a good roof and did not leak; they grew less frightened,
and Elizabeth grew warm in Aunt Susan&#8217;s arms and slept
at last. The rest lay long, listening to the angry blast,
counting up their losses and planning to reconstruct so as
to fit the new circumstances. For Luther another horse
would be needed, while Nathan would have to build a
house and furnish it anew.</p>
<p>After the wind subsided the two men discussed in low
tones the best way of beginning on the morrow, and it was
finally decided that Luther should go out and appeal to
the neighbours to gather together and assist in sorting
and saving such things as were worth it, and construct out
of the broken timbers a habitation which would shelter
them till a better could be erected. Fortunately, Luther
had used none of the lumber of his last load, and but little
of the one he had bought before.</p>
<p>It was almost morning before they fell asleep, and the
sun was shining brightly before they awoke. As they
emerged from the musty oats bin into the fresh air, which
had been purified by the wind and rain of the night before,
a curious sight met their eyes.</p>
<p>The house was indeed a wreck! Roof, side-walls, plaster,
floor, and furniture were mixed in one indistinguishable
mass. The kitchen table Nathan had mentioned
stood as a centre-pole under a leaning pile of boards and
splintered scantlings, and had evidently done much to
save the lives of its owners when the roof fell. One end
of the house lay, almost uninjured, on the grass, the
window panes unbroken and still in their frames. Other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
windows had been hurled from the walls to which they
belonged and ground to powder. Half the roof had been
deposited between the road and the rest of the débris as
carefully as if it had been lifted by some gigantic machinery,
and was unhurt, while the other side, splintered and
riddled, was jumbled together with joists, siding, and
kitchen chairs.</p>
<p>They spent but little time over the ruin of treasures,
but after a hurried breakfast, consisting of such eggs as
they could find about the haystacks, and coffee&mdash;rainsoaked,
but still coffee, which was dug out of a stone jar
where it had fallen&mdash;the men went at once for help.</p>
<p>In spite of bridges washed out, and many hindrances,
sympathetic farmers began to gather within two hours
after Luther had started out. The lumber he had offered
was brought and many willing hands began the erection of
the simple four-room house on the old foundation. The
place was cleared, furniture carried to one side, while
broken timbers were carried to the other and sorted, nails
drawn, and every available stick laid in neat piles ready for
those who had brought saws and hammers for building.</p>
<p>Susan and Elizabeth sorted the soaked and muddy
clothing, carpets, and bedclothes, and Mrs. Chamberlain
and other neighbour women, around a great out-of-door
fire near the well, washed and spread the clothes on the
grass to dry.</p>
<p>As if by magic, a house arose before night and, minus
doors and windows, but otherwise ready for occupancy,
offered its shelter to the tired but grateful family. Broken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
bedsteads had been mended and put in place, feather-beds
had been dried in the hot sun, straw ticks had been filled
with clean hay; broken chairs nailed or wired together
occupied their old places; the kitchen safe, with its doors
replaced but shutting grudgingly, was in its old corner,
and the unplastered house had a look of homey comfort
in spite of the lack of some of its usual features.</p>
<p>Luther, who was a sort of carpenter, donated his services
for several days, and except for patches of new
weather-boarding or shingles mixed with the old there was
little to indicate the path of a cyclone in the country.
Yes, there was a pile of splintered boards tossed roughly
together not far from the back door, and the usual fuel
of corncobs was below par.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;AGAINST HER INSTINCTS, AGAINST HER BETTER JUDGMENT, AGAINST HER WILL&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Hunter did not come to help, nor to call
upon Elizabeth and Susan Hornby, after the
disaster, and Elizabeth was finally obliged to
go to see John&#8217;s mother without any encouragement other
than Luther&#8217;s urging.</p>
<p>The day came at last when the call had to be made, and
for the first time Elizabeth came in contact with polite
society which smiles and bows in polite form without any
especial regard for sincerity. There was not a ripple of
discontent on the surface at her future home. Mrs.
Hunter might never have heard of the girl&#8217;s family difficulties.
The girl might have called the day before, so
courteous and charming was the dignified hospitality with
which she was accepted. Elizabeth felt as if the most
painful possibility of her life had been safely put behind
her. She had been nervous and uncomfortable about
this visit, and was correspondingly sensitive to the perfect
manner of her hostess, and carried away with her a new
problem to work upon: if John Hunter&#8217;s mother, by her
poise and presence, made of his home a social unit of appearance
and value, John Hunter&#8217;s wife must not fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
below the grade of that home when she became its mistress.
She pondered long upon that subtle air of good
breeding which ignored real issues and smoothed communication
by seeming not to know disagreeable facts.
Elizabeth decided that it was much more desirable than
the rugged honesty with which the primitive folk about
them would have humiliated themselves by explanation
and apology. She would copy that suavity of manner.
Also, she resolved not to discuss grievances. They were a
bore and it was horribly countrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not let myself think any more about it. I will
be myself, and not be affected by what the rest of the
folks do, and I&#8217;ll not let myself sit and fumble with my
buttons because some one else is going to think about
them. Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s manners are beautiful. I&#8217;d just
love her if I didn&#8217;t know I was going to have to live with
her,&#8221; she thought. Mrs. Hunter was a fixture in Elizabeth&#8217;s
mental world, and her estimates were the standards
Elizabeth considered when she sewed alone or when Aunt
Susan was silent. The girl was both fascinated and repelled
by them. Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s bearing was the subject
of constant and delighted meditation, while the cold carefulness
of it was a terrorizing nightmare. The girl kept
up a conversation with Aunt Susan on the sewing, or a
fire of mirth and jollity with Nathan or Luther, with this
undercurrent of thought always going on. How was she
to emulate that polish with so little experience in social
affairs she would ask herself one moment, and the next
would be harassed by the certainty that equal perfection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
in housekeeping and entertainment would be expected of
her. There was no escaping her fate. If she was to learn
these things, she must learn them of John&#8217;s mother. There
was no way of acquiring them beforehand. Elizabeth
faced her position squarely: she decided to accept her
teacher. At least Mrs. Hunter seemed willing to make it
easy for her.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth went home that night she spoke in
glowing terms of Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s friendly reception, and
praised the real merit of her housekeeping, letting Luther
see that she hoped to acquire it, and left the little group
around the supper table in great good humour because
the visit had been a success. She took Luther after the
meal was over and went to look for the eggs about the
haystacks, talking all the while of John Hunter&#8217;s mother
in the happiest manner she could assume. The visit to
John&#8217;s home had made her a bit homesick for John himself.
Luther&#8217;s presence had so completely filled the days
since John&#8217;s departure that she had not been lonesome
for him, but the house with which he was associated had
brought John back to the foreground of her consciousness
with a rush, and Luther saw that she was aglow with longing
for the man she was to marry. They did not walk as
usual after the eggs were hunted, but went back to the
house, where Elizabeth excused herself and soon went to
bed. John was expected now at any time.</p>
<p>When John did arrive two days later he found a welcome
awaiting him that was all that the most exacting of
men could have desired, a thing which astonished him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
somewhat, for rumour had reached him as soon as he had
come into the home neighbourhood that the new Swede
had cut him out. John came to see Elizabeth with curiosity
predominating in his mind, though there was a
distinct feeling of determination to master the situation if
rumour had been right.</p>
<p>Luther was not at the house when John Hunter arrived.
Elizabeth&#8217;s delight over her lover&#8217;s return was not a thing
to be deceived about, but one thing left its impress upon
his mind: Elizabeth called this new man by his given
name and spoke of him as one speaks of an intimate.
This was soon dismissed from John&#8217;s mind, however, for
Elizabeth was all agog to learn about the Mitchell County
land which he said he had bought, and John Hunter
stretched his legs out comfortably in the mended rocker
of Nathan Hornby&#8217;s little front room and talked enthusiastically
of the pasture he would have for surplus cattle
when he had got the farm in running order. No reference
was made to Elizabeth&#8217;s affairs with her family. John
was keenly appreciative of her joy in his presence, and
the old relations were renewed; in fact, the relations were
on a better basis than they had been for several days
before John&#8217;s absence. By a curious stroke of fate,
Luther was away from the house every time John Hunter
called for over a week. It whetted John&#8217;s interest in the
other man not to be able to see him, and it added an element
to the courtship which had threatened to disappear.
This other man on the scene made him apprehensive; he
wanted the centre of the stage for himself, and he became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
more ardent. Elizabeth was courted with sweet manner,
and all her wishes considered.</p>
<p>The summer was a happy one. Aside from a simple
white dress to be married in, and two calico dresses for
house wear, Elizabeth put her own sewing away and
helped Aunt Susan repair her quilts and carpets which
had suffered badly in the cyclone. Two weeks had to be
given up to the plastering of the remodelled house, and all
the furniture was revarnished by their own hands. By
the time all this was finished the girl felt a personal possession
in every article the house contained, and it had
indeed become a home to her. The home she had left
was scarcely more than a shadow in Elizabeth&#8217;s mind.
The work of remodelling and brightening up Nathan&#8217;s
house was hastened because of the wedding, which they
planned to have take place there. Susan Hornby and
Elizabeth had grown closer than ever since the storm,
when each had feared the loss of the other. They worked
and sewed together, skimping Nathan and Luther on the
cooking till the former threatened to turn cook in self-defence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw had not come to help when the neighbours
put up the demolished house. The bridges had
been out and no one had gone to warn her that help was
needed. When the news had arrived the omission had
been taken as an offence and no effort had been made to go
at all. The last week in September, however, Elizabeth&#8217;s
mother came to see her. The girl was helping Susan
Hornby put fresh straw under the rag carpet in the front
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
room. The straw was carefully spread and the carpet
tacked along one side of the room, and Elizabeth, hammer
in hand, turned over from her knees to a sitting position
and surveyed her mother with a dull fear at her heart; she
knew what her mother&#8217;s presence meant. Mrs. Farnshaw
resented the new carpet, she resented Susan Hornby, she
resented the comradeship she felt existed between her
daughter and this alien woman who was no relation to
her by the ties of blood. Ignoring Aunt Susan&#8217;s courteous
attempts to make her feel welcome, she drove straight to
the object of her visit and demanded that Elizabeth come
home to be married.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be married right here, ma,&#8221; Elizabeth
replied, twisting the hammer around in the other hand
and filled with apprehension. She knew her mother&#8217;s
tendency to hold fast to foolish demands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s ready handkerchief went up to her
eyes at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look a&#8217; here, Lizzie, I ain&#8217;t got no other girl, an&#8217;
it&#8217;s a pretty how-de-do if I can&#8217;t have my only daughter
married from my own house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth fidgeted about, laying her hammer down
and picking up a straw that had pushed its way
through the loose rags of the carpet on which she sat.
After a time she turned her eyes to Aunt Susan with
a mute call for help. Susan Hornby was decidedly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of course you&#8217;d come home to be married,&#8221;
Mrs. Farnshaw continued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You know pa &#8217;d raise a fuss as soon as I appeared,&#8221; her
daughter replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw brightened. She was strong on argument.
Elizabeth&#8217;s silence had disconcerted her, but if
she would talk&mdash;well, Mrs. Farnshaw began to have
hopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been away all summer,&#8221; she sobbed, returning
to her handkerchief.</p>
<p>Elizabeth kept her eyes on Aunt Susan&#8217;s face and did
not reply again. There was another silence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw began to be desperate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks has talked an&#8217; talked,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; I let
&#8217;em, because I thought when you come home for th&#8217;
weddin&#8217; it&#8217;d put a stop t&#8217; their tongues. You&#8217;ve been
down here, an&#8217; you don&#8217;t know how hard it&#8217;s been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had listened in a distressed silence and
studied Susan Hornby&#8217;s face for signs of assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they haven&#8217;t talked&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began at
length, and then stopped short at something in Aunt
Susan&#8217;s eye which confirmed her mother&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they have,&#8221; her mother hastened to say.
&#8220;They say you ain&#8217;t got no proper pride, an&#8217; they say
you&#8217;ve got too stuck up t&#8217; live to home any longer, now
that you&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; marry rich, an&#8217; they say I can&#8217;t make
your things good enough for you t&#8217; be married in, an&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw had voiced her greatest grievance&mdash;her
neighbours criticised her. She broke into such real
weeping that it was impossible not to be moved by it.</p>
<p>Forgetting her policy of silence, Elizabeth argued and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
explained. Talking to her mother, but keeping her eyes
glued on Aunt Susan&#8217;s, she went into details about the
difficulty at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know pa &#8217;ll find some excuse to strike me as soon
as I get there,&#8221; she concluded. She had a painful sense of
weakness and inadequacy in the presence of her mother&#8217;s
determination. Her own worries seemed so trivial in the
presence of her mother&#8217;s sorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;E won&#8217;t, I tell you,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw repeated for the
twentieth time. &#8220;E&#8217;ll let you alone if you do th&#8217; right
thing. We love our children&mdash;if th&#8217; neighbours don&#8217;t
think so,&#8221; she wailed.</p>
<p>As she talked, however, she kept a shrewd eye on her
daughter and soon saw that Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes turned to
those of Aunt Susan. It was not enough for this Hornby
woman to be neutral; Mrs. Farnshaw decided to enlist her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had a girl you&#8217;d want &#8217;er t&#8217; be married in your
own house, I know,&#8221; she said, leaning forward eagerly.
&#8220;Suppose you only had th&#8217; one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She saw the quick
tears gathering. &#8220;Did you ever have a little girl?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby&#8217;s emotions mastered her. She made no
attempt to reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell &#8217;er t&#8217; come home for just two more days,&#8221;
she said quickly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t ask for no more than that.
Just long enough to put an end t&#8217; this talk. I don&#8217;t never
&#8217;spect t&#8217; have &#8217;er after that, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet and, crossing the room, dragged
Elizabeth to her feet also.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got t&#8217; have you, Lizzie, an&#8217; that&#8217;s all th&#8217; is about
it!&#8221; They looked at each other a long time. Elizabeth
weakened.</p>
<p>What could the girl do? Against her instincts, against
her better judgment, against her will, she consented.</p>
<p>&#8220;See to it, then, that no new thing comes up to disgrace
us,&#8221; she said, stepping back to avoid the compelling touch
of the hand that clutched at her sleeve, still looking across
despairingly at Aunt Susan.</p>
<p>All help had been taken from that quarter. Bewildered,
torn between her comprehension of mother love and a real
knowledge of this particular case, Susan Hornby fumbled
with the hem of her apron and did not look up.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, alone and without support, was easily victimized.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; she said briefly.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>So the peaceful summer ended for Elizabeth Farnshaw
with her promise to go home. She hated to go, but the
phrasing of her mother&#8217;s plea, &#8220;just two more days,&#8221;
helped to sustain her. It had been a happy summer, two
days would not be long, and then would come John and
the new home.</p>
<p>There had been many reasons for the happiness of
Elizabeth&#8217;s last weeks of girlhood. The days had been
full of pleasant work, and John had taken regular and
masterful possession of her evenings. He came always
such a picture of natty cleanliness and taste that it was a
joy to be the object of his wooing. When John had found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
that Elizabeth was not in love with Luther, as she had
been reported to be, but accorded the old grounds of
affection to him, he had spread himself comfortably in
Luther&#8217;s presence and drawn him into conversation whenever
it could be done. In addition to a desire to set his
well-polished boots in strong contrast against those of
busy, unobserving Luther, the only dressing of which was
an occasional soaking in oil to keep them from cracking,
John Hunter had been half forced to like honest, kindly
Luther Hansen. Luther was not a man to arouse antagonisms.
He assumed his natural rôle with Elizabeth
even before her fiancé and let the ground of their cordiality
and friendship rest on such sensible basis that they were
accepted as a matter of course.</p>
<p>John Hunter had been restless and half angry when he
had first come home from Mitchell County&mdash;a thing he
had not let Elizabeth see&mdash;but his feelings had been
soothed and delighted by the display of her preference for
him on his return. A new buggy had been purchased,
and it was John Hunter&#8217;s pride.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was unconscious of any rivalry. The new
buggy was a great acquisition. It was the first to appear
in that part of the country. She felt favoured to have it
at her service, but the crown of all her felicity had been
John Hunter&#8217;s adoration, which had been poured at her
feet without stint. If she wished to go anywhere, she
had but to mention it. The relations of the early summer
had been reëstablished. He talked of the new land, and of
the cattle to be placed on it in two or three years, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
the calves he was buying would be grown. The lots in
which he had held an equity since his father&#8217;s death had
been sold before his mother&#8217;s departure from the old home,
and twenty-five calves had been picked up from the surrounding
farmers with the money thus secured. Every
evening John drove to some farm to look for young cattle,
and Elizabeth accompanied him. Cash had been paid
for the Western land, and at the end of the summer most
of the money that had been received from the estate had
been invested.</p>
<p>As they drove from farm to farm, discussing prices;
sheds, feed, and the wintering of stock, the girl&#8217;s heart
swelled with gratitude that her lines had fallen in such
well-provided places. The pinch of poverty was to be
lifted from her life.</p>
<p>More than the plenty, Elizabeth prized the peace which
seemed to be drifting in her direction.</p>
<p>Every day since John Hunter&#8217;s return had been a happy
day. John consulted her judgment and her wishes, and
it was done with that air of comradeship which was the
most sought-for thing in Elizabeth Farnshaw&#8217;s life. All
her lonely days she had longed for it, and in all her girlish
dreams it had been the prime factor. She had obtained
glimpses of it in Susan Hornby&#8217;s home, and now, she told
herself joyfully, it was to be a permanent feature of her
future life.</p>
<p>With Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s advent a series of unpleasant
things began to manifest. John was glad that the marriage
was to take place in Elizabeth&#8217;s own home. Because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of their engagement, he had heard little of the gossip about
her, but it had been enough to make him suspect more and
wish her well out of it. If now she would go home it
would make the whole thing look right and stop the
reports.</p>
<p>John Hunter was distinctly a man of moods and reflected
the conditions in which he happened for the
moment to find himself. When he came to see Elizabeth
the night after her mother had been to see her, he
was pleased that she was to go home the next day, but
he instantly partook of the discontent she showed. He
took her to his mother&#8217;s house for a short stay, but both
were heavy of spirits and John was actually depressed.
Elizabeth was almost abnormally sensitive to the attitude
assumed toward her, and had she been shrewd she would
never have carried any doubts of her own efficiency or
judgment to her lover, but she was as open as a little child.
John left her at the little gate and drove away so promptly
that the girl&#8217;s lip quivered as she turned in the dark to go
to the house.</p>
<p>Elizabeth found Luther seated on the low doorstep.
The shadow of the house prevented her from seeing him
till she was almost upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all things! I never thought of you being here,&#8221;
she exclaimed, thinking of the kiss she had just received
not three rods distant.</p>
<p>Luther laughed sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t intended t&#8217; see your good-nights,&#8221; he said
honestly, &#8220;but I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; made a worse mess of it by runnin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
than I did by settin&#8217; still. Anyhow, you&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; be
married in three days, an&#8217; it needn&#8217;t make no difference.
I&#8217;ve been a thinkin&#8217; about you an&#8217; I waited up t&#8217; talk.&#8221;
He made room on the step for her to sit beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Mrs. Hornby says your mother was here to-day.
She&#8217;s kind of worried about it&mdash;you goin&#8217; home, I mean.
I don&#8217;t know about that&mdash;I hope It&#8217;ll be all right. Try
an&#8217; make it right, Lizzie. Th&#8217; Hunters go a good deal on
looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was silent.</p>
<p>Luther felt it and interpreted her silence rightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that something I&#8217;m not to talk about, Lizzie?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>The question hurt worse than the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know why you ask me such a thing,
Luther,&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>Luther arose. He was not to be offended, nor would he
put away what he had waited to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted to say that&mdash;well, do what th&#8217; folks
ask of you, Lizzie. You&#8217;re only home for a couple of days
an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;after a long pause&mdash;&#8220;an&#8217; it won&#8217;t hurt
nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth got up slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Luther,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She wanted to offer him her hand; she was sure she was
hurting him, but she could not talk to him on this point;
the very truth of his suspicious that the Hunter estimate
of her might be affected by scandal made of it a sore point.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
Elizabeth Farnshaw would be loyal to mutual relations,
even where Luther&#8217;s feelings were concerned.</p>
<p>They met in the morning on perfectly friendly ground,
but there was an attitude of reserve which brooked no
remark on her part. Luther departed early for his own
house, and John Hunter came before noon to take her to
her father&#8217;s home. After all her simple possessions were
in the wagon, Elizabeth went back and threw herself into
the arms of Aunt Susan, who was crying miserably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Susan! I feel as if I had taken leave of you
forever. I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve been so happy in this house&mdash;till
yesterday. Can I ever repay what you&#8217;ve done for
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby gathered Elizabeth into her arms and
sobbed more vehemently. The silence was unbroken except
by those sobs, and at last the girl, moved out of herself,
tried to comfort her, and said coaxingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll live right near you. I&#8217;ll see you every few days
and&mdash;and I&#8217;ll never forget how good you&#8217;ve been to me.
It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s too bad these last two days had to be so&mdash;so
different. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what went wrong, but&mdash;but&#8221;&mdash;she
laughed desperately&mdash;&#8220;where have our good
times gone to? I&#8217;m going to be married to the man I
love&mdash;and I&#8217;m going to live right near you&mdash;and&mdash;what
is the matter with us, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby clung to the girl and could not cease crying,
till at last Elizabeth lifted her chin on one finger and
with a corner of Aunt Susan&#8217;s own apron, wiped the tears
from the contorted face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; she said, kissing her again and
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the folks in a good humour, dear. The Hunters &#8217;ll
feel awful if anything more happens,&#8221; Susan Hornby
faltered, and then, to keep the girl from, replying, and to
avoid the surprise and pain in the young face, pushed her
gently but firmly toward the door and John Hunter, who
was waiting impatiently.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>PHILOSOPHY OF ELIZABETH&#8217;S LIFE VOICED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; Elizabeth said, significantly, as
John turned back to get into the wagon after they
had deposited the trunk in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; John smiled back at her. It was a
reluctant smile he gave her, but the bid for affection in
her young eyes was irresistible.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had to be nice,&#8221; she thought as she walked back
to the house; &#8220;it was a good way.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden thought came to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ask Luther to the wedding?&#8221; she asked of her
mother as she entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. What do you want of that Swede?&#8221;
Mrs. Farnshaw asked petulantly. &#8220;I should think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>What she thought was never recorded in words, for
Elizabeth was out of the house like a flash, calling to John
Hunter as she ran down the road after him. It was a
surprised John who took her message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll tell him, but I don&#8217;t see what you want of
that Swede&mdash;he always seems to cut such a figure in
everything you do,&#8221; John said discontentedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just tell him that ma sends the invitation, will
you?&#8221; was all Elizabeth could say.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>It was John&#8217;s first contemptuous remark about Luther,
and it disturbed her. They were to live closer to Luther
Hansen than any other neighbour and it was essential
that they be on friendly terms. She had hoped it might
be that John would appreciate the good things in Luther
which even his nationality could not spoil. Dear old
Luther! In spite of the observation she had seemed to
resent the night before, Elizabeth loved him&mdash;loved him
all the more because she had been obliged to hurt him. It
suddenly occurred to her that John might not deliver her
message. She put the thought away from her instantly,
saying aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d do anything he knew I wanted him to do,&#8221; and
then was struck with the doubtful tone in which it was
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; her mother asked, for Elizabeth
had just entered the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I hate this wedding!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I like that, after all I&#8217;ve done to give you a
good time,&#8221; the mother said angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma; you mean to give yourself a good time. You
make me come home when I don&#8217;t want to, and you ask
people I hate to have, and then you leave out the people I
want most. It isn&#8217;t my wedding. I&#8217;m going to stand up
and be married so as to get rid of it all, but John won&#8217;t
have the minister I want, you won&#8217;t have the people I
want, I&#8217;m most sure pa &#8217;ll kick up some kind of a row
about it&mdash;and&mdash;and I was so happy till you came and
made me consent to it. What did you do it for?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do it for? You ungrateful child! What did I do it
for? I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s eyes hardened into
momentary coals of fire. &#8220;I did it because I don&#8217;t like
your whole goings on. Minister? Why don&#8217;t you say
preacher, like the rest of your folks? It&#8217;s that Hornby
woman. She made you talk of divorces&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; At
thought of all her supposed wrongs at the hand of Susan
Hornby Mrs. Farnshaw broke into a half scream and
ended by throwing herself into a chair by her daughter&#8217;s
side and clinging to her hand with her upturned face
streaming over with tears, her mouth convulsed with pain
till speech was impossible.</p>
<p>Moved to repentance at the sight of the pang she had
caused, Elizabeth fell on her knees by her mother&#8217;s side,
and with her arms encircling her, cried contritely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it, ma, really&mdash;that is, I didn&#8217;t mean
it that way. Don&#8217;t mind what I said. I do love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw clung to her, so shaken by sobs that she
still could not speak, and the penitent daughter soothed
and comforted her with her own heart breaking at the
thoughtlessness of her speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it away and don&#8217;t remember it; I didn&#8217;t mean it.
I&#8217;m tired to death&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She pondered a
moment and then made the experiment. &#8220;And I want to
speak of Aunt Susan to you. I can&#8217;t bear to have you feel
so bad about me liking her. She hasn&#8217;t put a single notion
into my head. Be good and get acquainted with her.
She&#8217;d like to have you. If you knew her you&#8217;d know how
different she is from what you think. I&#8217;ll take you to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
her the very first time you come to see me. Say you
will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth stroked the thin hair back from the passion-worn
face, and waited for her reply.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw shook her head, but could not meet the
offer squarely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two of you&#8217;d be a wishin&#8217; you could get rid of me
so&#8217;s you could talk your own kind of talk,&#8221; she said with
conviction. &#8220;&#8217;Taint any use, Lizzie; I ain&#8217;t your kind.
Your pa &#8217;d be madder at me &#8217;n ever, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s mad all the time, anyhow,&#8221; Elizabeth
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No &#8217;e wasn&#8217;t till you said that awful thing&mdash;that is,
&#8217;e was mad often enough, but not like &#8217;e&#8217;s been since.
You don&#8217;t know what you done t&#8217; your mother then. Be
good, an&#8217; go t&#8217; &#8217;im, an&#8217; settle &#8217;is mind &#8217;fore you&#8217;re married.
It don&#8217;t matter if I know Miss Hornby &#8217;r not; but what
a difference it&#8217;d make t&#8217; me if he only knowed I never
put you up t&#8217; that partin&#8217; business! Please do it fur me,
Lizzie.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was an unexpected turn. Elizabeth had hoped to
avoid the recurrence of this issue. Knowing that she was
keeping her mother in cruel suspense, Elizabeth hesitated
and by every sign showed her disinclination to discuss the
subject. What should she do? What <i>could</i> she do?
The tortured eyes of her mother studied her with an intensity
which she could not avoid. To consent was to
fail with her father, to refuse was to make matters much
worse with the mother she had just hurt. Luther had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
warned her to avoid collisions with her family which
were liable to cause gossip; Aunt Susan had implored her
to keep the folks in a good humour; her own instincts were
against the movement, but her feelings were pleading for
the mother who begged her to try once again to obtain
reconciliation before she was married. Ah! if this time
would end it!</p>
<p>&#8220;Say you will,&#8221; the mother begged with pathetic
brevity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do it in a minute if there were the least opportunity
to succeed, ma,&#8221; Elizabeth said reluctantly, and not looking
toward her. &#8220;If I do it and fail, You&#8217;ll be wanting me
to go right on with it after I&#8217;m married, and that I won&#8217;t
do for anybody.&#8221; The sentence ended savagely.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw studied her daughter eagerly. She began
to have hopes. Now, if only she could get the right
touch on her appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;If You&#8217;ll do it, an&#8217; be careful-like, Lizzie,&#8221; she said
compellingly, &#8220;if You&#8217;ll be careful-like this time, I&#8217;ll never
ask you again. I can&#8217;t live this way any longer. I won&#8217;t
never ask you again. Please,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Speak real
soft an&#8217; nice-like. Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, ma, are you crazy? You told me&mdash;you told me
that&mdash;oh dear, what&#8217;s the use to tell you what you said?&#8221;
the girl cried, her judgment giving its last caution a
hearing.</p>
<p>What was the use indeed!</p>
<p>In the end Elizabeth consented&mdash;consented with kindliness
of manner. Since she was going to do it at all she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
would do it lovingly. She argued herself into that mood
before she agreed to the move. Her mother had a hard
life; on one who knew her doubted that fact. Neither
would any one have doubted that Mr. Farnshaw led a
hard life also. Some devil of unrest demanded excitement
and disagreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the folks in a good humour,&#8221; Luther had said.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had no support from any quarter. She could
only consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, ma,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;I am going away to be
happy. John and his mother never have a word together
that isn&#8217;t pleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw said with relief, &#8220;but men
don&#8217;t always treat their wives like they do their mothers.
It&#8217;s something they get t&#8217; feel about their wives that&#8217;s th&#8217;
trouble. Women think th&#8217; only way t&#8217; be good wives&#8217;s
t&#8217; give up&mdash;an&#8217; men think so too. Women&#8217;s most always
afraid of what th&#8217; men &#8217;ll think, an&#8217; th&#8217; men know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ma, come on! There&#8217;s lots to do; let&#8217;s get at
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was in no mood to philosophize. She hated
the coming conference with her father to the utter exclusion
of every other thought at that moment, and had
hardly heard what her mother had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never regret bein&#8217; good t&#8217; your old mother,&#8221;
Mrs. Farnshaw said, rubbing her hand over the girl&#8217;s
glossy braids as Elizabeth turned away to begin the work
she had suggested. &#8220;My! it don&#8217;t seem like six weeks
since I was your age&mdash;young an&#8217; startin&#8217; out&mdash;an&#8217; life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
looked good t&#8217; me, I kin tell you. Now I ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217;
t&#8217; be good t&#8217; me but you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll wash my hair before the sun gets low,&#8221;
Elizabeth said. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll help you in here.&#8221; She was
disturbed about the promise she had given and wanted to
get away from her mother before she should say some unlucky
thing that would show it. She let her hair down and
loosened it with a toss of her head. It was a glittering
garment which covered her from head to knees in wavy
strands which flew about her in lines of beauty as she
moved about getting her hot water and towels. Mrs.
Farnshaw watched her with an expression near real affection.
She came over and ran her hands through the rippling
mass as the girl turned to go out of doors where she
could splash comfortably, and after she had gone passed
her hands over her own faded locks slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie&#8217;s always had th&#8217; best of everything,&#8221; she said,
shaking her head sadly. &#8220;I wisht she wasn&#8217;t s&#8217; set against
&#8217;er pa. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; make &#8217;er do it all th&#8217; same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl in the backyard pondered upon the same thing
as she dried her hair in the hot sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate it,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to do it just
the best I know how. Ma <i>didn&#8217;t</i> say it, nor agree with it,
and I&#8217;m going to make it as easy as I can for her before I
go. Will we ever be like they are?&#8221; she asked herself half
seriously, and felt sure it could not be. &#8220;Ma has always
insisted on things and never lets pa nor the rest of us
forget anything or lay it down. I believe a woman can
manage those things. Aunt Susan does.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>As Elizabeth started to the house, she noticed her
father and the boys coming from the cornfield with a
wagon-load of snapped corn. Joe drove the team and
his father sat in the back with his feet dangling over the
end-gate. They were turning into the barnyard when she
discovered them.</p>
<p>With her hair floating about her like a veil, she started
at once for the barn. She could not talk this out with her
mother listening, and if she did not do it now it would be
forced upon her at supper, when her father was certain to
be in his worst mood. Mr. Farnshaw always came to the
table tired.</p>
<p>Seeing Elizabeth coming toward him, Mr. Farnshaw
dropped from the wagon and went to fill the swill pails.
The hogs knew they were to be fed and set up their usual
noisy clamour. It was his purpose to divert their attention
till the boys could drive the wagon into the corral,
hoping also to leave his daughter where she could not approach
him. Mr. Farnshaw delighted in making people
wait. With a pail in either hand he advanced to the
fence. The hogs left the gate and ran to meet him, upsetting
the trough as they came. Setting the pails down,
he snatched up a peeled osage stick, kept outside of the
pen for that purpose, and belaboured angrily the snouts
sticking over the fence. The pigs were hungry and persistent.
By the time they were beaten into a respectable
awe and had backed away squealing, Mr. Farnshaw
discovered his daughter at his elbow. He had intended
to ignore her; he turned red with rage. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
a look of infinite contempt, he stooped and picked up a
pail.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a racket they do make,&#8221; she remarked, smiling
at him without offence.</p>
<p>In spite of her smiling manner, Elizabeth was half sick
with apprehension. It was not a propitious time to approach
him, but Mr. Farnshaw watched to see that a
propitious moment should not arrive when he was in one
of his sulking fits. Elizabeth had played that game with
him before. With her courage oozing away, and a feeling
that there was no benefit in seeming not to know what he
was thinking about, she put her hand on his sleeve saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cross with me, pa. Really I <i>do</i> want to
be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw jerked his arm aside to avoid her touch
and spilled half the pail of swill on the ground. He lurched
over to the other side to right the pail; the bucket at his
feet upset, pouring dishwater, milk, and potato peelings
over his heavy plow-shoes as it went. To avoid the onrush
of the greasy tide he sprang back, slipped in its oily
overflow, and fell, the pail he held pouring its contents
over him as he went. His gray whiskers, the bottom of his
jersey, his very ears dripped swill as he arose. It was
disconcertingly funny, and the girl helped him to his feet,
laughing in spite of every effort to restrain herself.</p>
<p>To lose his temper was bad enough, but to be made
ridiculous and be laughed at at the same time was more
than the man could endure. He was insane with fury.
There was such a look of malignity on his face as he jerked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
away and turned to face her that the girl, suddenly sobered,
dodged and started to run. Her long hair trailed across
his arm, and lost to every consideration but that of satisfying
his temper, he caught it as she passed and swinging
the osage stick to which he still clung, shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you! This is th&#8217; kind of friends I&#8217;ll be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He struck with all his force, jerking her hair at the same
time. Thrown from her feet, the full weight of the girl&#8217;s
body came on her hair. It hurt cruelly. She veered
around on her knees and caught the now tangled hair with
both hands to ease the strain. He grabbed her by one
arm and rained blows on her thinly clad shoulders which
hissed in tune with the man&#8217;s temper as they fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be friends with you!&#8221; he shrieked. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you
t&#8217; that young smartie with some marks on you that&#8217;ll show
&#8217;im what kind of a wife he&#8217;s gettin&#8217;. You told your ma
t&#8217; leave me! Maybe You&#8217;ll be leavin&#8217; him next. Tell &#8217;im
I said so, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cut by the flexible withe, which left welts like ribbons
on her young shoulders, the girl was unable to endure
more passively, and struggled to free herself. The partially
successful opposition infuriated the man. He was
not accustomed to defence. His fury knew no restraint.
He rained the blows harder than ever and the girl finally
caught the whip itself. Catching the limber end desperately,
she jerked it sidewise; unconsciously, she had
deflected her father&#8217;s hand so that it struck her head just
below the ear. It stretched her senseless at his feet.</p>
<p>Josiah Farnshaw was aghast. With a gulping cry of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
alarm and pity, he stooped to lift his unconscious daughter.
He had not intended to do so brutal a thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look what you&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; done!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw had watched Elizabeth go to him with
something of prayer in her heart. She knew the girl&#8217;s
intention was to be square about the apology and she
had strained every nerve to watch the encounter. At the
first blow she had started to the scene of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you might have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s relenting mood vanished. He dropped the
limp body and rose to his full height.</p>
<p>&#8220;You damned fool,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;if you hadn&#8217;t set
this a goin&#8217; an&#8217; kept it a goin&#8217; this wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; happened.
Of all th&#8217; blasted, impossible things it&#8217;s t&#8217; have a snivelling
she-devil always at your elbow. Keep your hands off of
me!&#8221; he cried, shaking himself loose from the detaining
hand she had laid on his arm. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; git.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys had arrived by that time. They carried the
girl to the well and bathed her face and hands with fresh
water, while the head of the house strode down the road
toward the north. Elizabeth was not seriously injured
and recovered consciousness as soon as the water touched
her. Mrs. Farnshaw left the task of resuscitation to her
sons and looked after her rapidly disappearing husband
with eyes that longed for reconciliation. Reconciliation
for one thing or another had been the most driving inspiration
her twenty years of married life had known; it was
her most potent incentive. Cowed and broken, fear
bound her fast to his footsteps. Not even the daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
struggling to her feet at her side could detract her attention
from his receding form.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stood balancing herself dizzily for a moment
before she began really to see or grasp what was going on
around her; then the full value of the mishap broke upon
her. All that Luther and Aunt Susan had hinted at had
befallen her in spite of every effort to avoid it.</p>
<p>But not even the calamity which had befallen them
could stop their busy fingers. The preparations for the
wedding feast were a merciful feature of the rest of the
evening. The guests had been invited and must be prepared
for. The hair that had been washed was braided,
the mother&#8217;s tears dried, and every member of the family
pressed into the service. The entire house was cleaned
and rearranged. Not till after midnight did the members
of the little group seek their beds. Mr. Farnshaw had not
returned. They had even forgotten him a large part of
the time in the hurry. Elizabeth regarded the half dozen
bruises which her sleeves would not cover with alarm when
she was at last ready to climb her ladder. Joe covered
them with a liniment which he brought from the barn. As
he set the dusty bottle on the kitchen table after the
anointing had been done, he remarked dryly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if you an&#8217; me &#8217;ll ever do that kind of thing t&#8217;
our young ones? Everybody&#8217;s always said we was like
the old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that nasty smellin&#8217; bottle out of here, an&#8217; don&#8217;t
begin any talk about your pa. Everybody get t&#8217; bed,&#8221;
Mrs. Farnshaw commanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Even the absence of her husband could not dim the
interest of Mrs. Farnshaw in the coming spectacle of her
daughter&#8217;s marriage. With the capacity of a little child
to suffer from unkindness or neglect, she combined the
same child-like capability to enjoy pageantry of any sort.
Benches for curious neighbours surrounded Mrs. Farnshaw&#8217;s
bed when she retired, and unaccustomed things
filled every nook of the usually unattractive room. Evergreen
boughs stared at her from the corner opposite her
bed; the bed was to be removed in the morning. It had
been her own romantic idea to have a bower for the bride
and groom. She had been so busy making that bower that
she had forgotten her own troubles for an hour and more,
but she remembered them now and her interest died out.
With a quivering indrawn breath she turned out the light
and dived into the huge feather-bed, smothering her sobs
by crushing her pillow against her face.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, upstairs, had her own disappointments to go
over, and her mother&#8217;s sobbing coloured her ruminations.
Her vision had been cleared. In spite of youth, and of
humiliation, she saw that the blow that had undone her
had been accidental. She saw what the encouragement
of temper would lead to. She saw the gradual growth and
stimulation of that temper in the daily contentions of her
father and mother.</p>
<p>She rubbed her bruises and thought long on the troubles
about her. Accusations and defence, she decided, were
at the root of them. They were the universal topics of
the conversations at home and among all the people she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
had ever known except the Hornbys and the Chamberlains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Defence!&#8221; she said in a scornful whisper. &#8220;What does
it matter <i>who</i> is wrong in anything? The only thing that
matters is <i>what</i> is wrong and to find a way to make it come
out better next time,&#8221; and at last went to sleep quite unaware
that she had evolved a philosophy which rightly
applied would reorganize the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;WIVES, SUBMIT YOURSELVES UNTO YOUR HUSBANDS, AS UNTO THE LORD&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The day after the wedding was Friday, or &#8220;sweep
day,&#8221; as Mrs. Hunter called it. Anxious to begin
as she expected to hold out, and to form regular
habits in John&#8217;s wife, Mrs. Hunter superintended the
housecleaning processes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had had no idea that any one could put in so
many hours with broom and dust rag, but when it was
done, looked about her with housekeeperly delight in the
orderly, well-kept rooms. As they had worked that day
the girl had been keenly observant of John&#8217;s mother. She
could not tell whether John had told her of the trouble in
her home or not. Mrs. Hunter did not refer to it directly
or indirectly, and this fact was the subject of much
thought. This faultless manner of dismissing unpleasant
things stood out in strong contrast to the endless and tiresome
discussions to which the girl was accustomed. Elizabeth
wished she could find time to run over to Uncle
Nate&#8217;s for a chat with Aunt Susan, but the busy day
absorbed her and there was no time to go anywhere; in
fact, it was time for John to come home from Colebyville,
where he had gone to hunt for a hired man before the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
cleaning was really finished. Glancing up at the clock
on the lambrequined shelf in the sitting room, the girl
was surprised to see that it was already four o&#8217;clock. The
cleaning was finished and she ran to the kitchen to put
up the rag in her hand, and then went hurriedly into her
bedroom to comb her hair and get her dress changed before
John should come.</p>
<p>Absorbed in her dressing, Elizabeth did not hear her
husband enter the house until she heard him talking to
his mother in the dining room. With freshly combed
hair and clean calico dress she ran with a glad little bound
to meet him.</p>
<p>John Hunter and his mother stopped short with their
conversation when they saw her and were plainly embarrassed.</p>
<p>The young wife became conscious that something was
wrong and stopped in the middle of the room, looking
from one to the other in mute inquiry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter turned and went back to the kitchen.
John came toward his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, John? What has happened?&#8221; she asked
in a whisper. There was a sick look on John Hunter&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not put her hand on him as was her usual
way. The girl-wife had an indistinct feeling that her
husband and his mother were a combination for the
moment of which she was not a part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough has happened,&#8221; the man said, passing her and
going toward their bedroom. &#8220;Come in here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>He held the door open for her to enter, and she passed in
and stood waiting while he shut it behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, John?&#8221; she queried, unable to wait longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father has gone to Colebyville and got into a
drunken row,&#8221; was the bald statement. &#8220;Everybody in
the country knows about his fuss with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not offer to touch her, but walked over to the
window and began to drum on the window-pane with
nervous fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drunk! Row! My father was never drunk in his
life!&#8221; was the astonished exclamation with which Elizabeth
Hunter met this unbelievable accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s been drunk enough to last the rest of his
life this time, and we&#8217;re the laughing stock of this whole
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter had gone to Colebyville that morning in
the new buggy, rather pleased to be the centre of observation
and remark. He quite liked to swagger before these
country people whom he chose otherwise to ignore. He
was well dressed, his buggy was the admired of all admirers,
and he was newly married. Country gossip had some
pleasing qualifications. When he had arrived at Colebyville,
however, John Hunter had found that country people
had little ways of their own for the edification of the
vainglorious, and that trim young men in buggies became
infinitely more interesting to the scorned when they could
be associated with scandal. He soon found that he was
the object of much amused discussion and shortly it became
evident that they were quite willing that he should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
know that he was the object of ridicule. Pretending
friendship, one of them enlightened him as to the exact
circumstances which were amusing them, and then
sneaked back to his companions with a verbatim report of
his surprised exclamations. John Hunter did not enjoy
being the victim of a trap laid by those he had patronized.
It had been a humiliating day, and John Hunter always
handed his misfortunes along. He poured his disgust over
his wife as if she alone were responsible for all he had suffered
that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the row with you about, anyway?&#8221; he inquired
with evident aversion to her presence.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had withered into a quivering semblance of
the confident woman who had run to meet him five minutes
ago. Her knees shook under her with collapse. She
sat down on the edge of the bed and stammered her explanations
as if she had been a naughty child caught red-handed
in some act of which she was ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;oh, John! I only went to him to make up about&mdash;about
other things. We&mdash;we didn&#8217;t have any fuss
exactly. It&mdash;it was just the same old thing. I&mdash;I
begged ma not to make me go home. I told her what he
would&mdash;I knew he&#8217;d whip me, but she would have me
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he couldn&#8217;t whip you for nothing,&#8221; John said,
with brutal inquiry. &#8220;What&#8217;d you fall out with him
for? I never heard of such a thing as a girl who was a
woman grown that fell out with her father till he whipped
her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>Exasperated and miserable, John bestowed blame in
the only convenient place he found.</p>
<p>The young wife buried her face in the counterpane and
did not attempt to reply, and after looking dully at her
for a moment John Hunter went out and left her to carry
her burden of shame alone. The sound of the closing door
assured her that at least she could be alone in her tears,
and the humbled girl gave herself up to sobbing. Luther
and Aunt Susan would never be quite convinced that she
had done her best to avoid trouble; she even wondered
herself if there might not have been some fault in the way
she had approached her father. As usual, Elizabeth was
concerned with the trouble of others. The whole dreadful
thing passed before her with the vividness of actual
reproduction. John&#8217;s mother knew this at any rate. That
was a sore point. They were in the kitchen talking it
over now! With the conviction of absolute certainty,
Elizabeth buried her face in the counterpane of her bridal
couch and sobbed in desolate abandon.</p>
<p>After a time John came back again and looked into the
room. Seeing her distress, he went over slowly and lifted
her to her feet with a stir of pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; he said gloomily. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped.
Come on out to the kitchen and help mother with the
supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew that at that moment he did not want
to caress her, but her hungry soul craved comfort beyond
her power to control and she dug her face into his breast
and sobbed there unasked.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 379px;'>
&#8220;THE YOUNG WIFE BURIED HER FACE IN THE COUNTERPANE AND DID NOT ATTEMPT TO REPLY&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>John&#8217;s arms closed about her in a relaxed sort of way,
and patting her head half-heartedly, he said again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, dear. Mother&#8217;s out there getting supper
alone.&#8221; He took his own pocket handkerchief and wiped
her tear-stained face and, after kissing her, pushed her
gently but firmly toward the kitchen.</p>
<p>Supper was not a cheerful meal. Elizabeth&#8217;s voice was
thick from crying and she did not talk at all, while John
and his mother could not discuss the topic uppermost in
their minds in her presence. The feeling that there was a
combination of which she was not a part grew upon the
young wife, and a longing for Aunt Susan grew with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go over to Uncle Nate&#8217;s immediately after
supper,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the dishes while you hitch up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord! I don&#8217;t want to go over there to-night,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d quit calling those people
&#8216;Aunt&#8217; and &#8216;Uncle&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s face blazed with colour as he got up and
went into the sitting room. The brutality of the answer
was so evident to John&#8217;s mother that she followed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better take Elizabeth to Mr. Hornby&#8217;s, John.
I don&#8217;t think you should speak to her in that way, either,&#8221;
she said in a low tone of voice.</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not hear Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s remarks, but
John&#8217;s reply was audible enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going over there to-night. I don&#8217;t feel as if
I ever wanted to go anywhere again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also heard Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s low &#8220;Sh!&#8221; and felt more
than ever an alien.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>When the dishes were finished Mrs. Hunter went upstairs.
John followed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not be hurt, because I will not see hurt,&#8221; Elizabeth
told herself as she slipped through the house to her
own room. Because her lips quivered as she said it, she
busied herself in taking down her hair to brush for the
night. Her sleeves were tight and hindered, and she took
off her dress and folded it across the back of a chair carefully,
and finished braiding her hair in her petticoat.</p>
<p>John found her with her white arms uplifted as she
combed the long strands. Moved by her girlish beauty and
freshness, he went over and put his arms about her. The
girl&#8217;s mouth was full of hairpins, and she mumbled something
he did not understand. He kept his arms about her
insistently, and rubbed his chin on her smooth shoulder
with a little laugh. She struggled to free herself, but he
held her teasingly, and finally accepting the playful tussle
as an apology, though she knew it was not an adequate
one, she gave up. She was resolved not to split hairs
with her husband over small matters; she would not nurse
grievances.</p>
<p>As for John Hunter, he had not thought of apology,&mdash;or
of the necessity of one; he had been moved by the
sight of the tempting figure of the woman he possessed.</p>
<p>Elizabeth loved her husband and wished to believe that
he loved her; she was unwilling to begin her married life
with any sort of whining or suspicion, so she ended the
matter by resting unresisting in his arms and turning her
young face up to be kissed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>The next morning Elizabeth washed the dishes alone,
and Mrs. Hunter followed John to the barn and later to
the pasture, where he went to catch a horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going with a horse?&#8221; his mother asked
as they passed through the pasture gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to go over to Chamberlain&#8217;s to help with a
small stack of hay he put up in the field and wants to
move, now that he&#8217;s got the time. I told him he&#8217;d better
let me help him before the new hired man comes to begin
the husking; I&#8217;m going to need the team every day after
that,&#8221; John replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you got a man, did you?&#8221; Mrs. Hunter said, catching
hold of his arm to keep him from outwalking her.
&#8220;If you&#8217;re going as far as Chamberlain&#8217;s you&#8217;d better take
Elizabeth over to Mr. Hornby&#8217;s while you&#8217;re hitched up.
I&#8217;ll get dinner. You hurt her feelings last night, and
that&#8217;ll be a good way to make it right with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, mother,&#8221; John Hunter answered decidedly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind. With this story
going around we&#8217;ll stay at home where we belong. Anyhow,
the sooner she&#8217;s cut away from these country jakes
the better for her, and I&#8217;ll begin right here and now. I
don&#8217;t intend&mdash;never have intended&mdash;to have these
people tacked to my coat-tails every move I make. If
she&#8217;s hurt, She&#8217;ll simply have to get over it; besides, she
didn&#8217;t stay mad long&mdash;you saw that for yourself. She&#8217;s
all right if she&#8217;s managed right.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true, Mrs. Hunter reflected. Elizabeth had not
seemed to take much offence, and was perfectly good-natured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
this morning. She did not intend to interfere
with the affairs of her son and his wife. Elizabeth seemed
submissive, and promised well. She hoped that this
horrid gossip would die down. That was a nasty thing
to be mixed up with. Mr. Hunter had never had anything
like that happen to him before, and she was devoutly glad
they were away out here in Kansas where no one who had
ever known them would hear it. Elizabeth would be all
the better as a wife if she did not start out by running
around too much. It did not occur to Mrs. Hunter, nor
to her son, that if the old acquaintances were to be taken
away from Elizabeth that in all justice she must be provided
with new ones. In fact, it did not occur to them
at all that her opinions were of any value whatever. Why
should John explain his plans to her? Why, indeed?</p>
<p>As she went about her Saturday morning&#8217;s work Elizabeth
watched John and his mother stroll down the path
in the pasture, certain that she herself was the subject of
their conversation, and her eyes burned with unshed
tears. The intimacy between John and his mother seemed
so much more firmly established than the intimacy between
John and herself that she was filled with lonesomeness
and a longing for Aunt Susan.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow&#8217;s Sunday and there&#8217;ll be nothing to do.
He&#8217;ll have to take me then. He was tired and upset by
that horrid talk last night. Oh, why do I have to be
mixed up with things I can&#8217;t help&mdash;and&mdash;and have him
cross, and everything?&#8221; She ended with a little shuddering
cry, and buried her head in the kitchen towel and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
gave up to the tears which, now that she was alone, she
could candidly shed. How she longed for Aunt Susan,
and yet she could not have talked to her of these things;
but in spite of that she wanted her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Will you go over to&mdash;to Mrs. Hornby&#8217;s with us to-day?&#8221;
she asked Mrs. Hunter at the breakfast table the
next morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;if you&#8217;re going,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter answered
with a hesitant glance at John.</p>
<p>The tone and the hesitancy struck Elizabeth. She
looked at John as she had seen the older woman do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother spoke yesterday of your going,&#8221; John said
quickly, &#8220;and I said&mdash;well, I want to get some more
cleaning done about that barn before the man comes.
There&#8217;s plenty of time about that. Let them come here
if they want to see us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to go,&#8221; Elizabeth persisted. She had been
accustomed to dictating where John Hunter should take
her. John himself had taught her to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s plenty of time. I&#8217;m busy to-day, if it is
Sunday,&#8221; was all that her husband thought it necessary
to reply.</p>
<p>The hope that Aunt Susan would come to see her if she
found that they were not coming over helped Elizabeth
to accept the brusque refusal better than she otherwise
would have done. John was cheerful and pleasant, and
the hurt that she had felt at first died away. He asked
her to go to the barn with him and was merry and full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
of small talk and chatter, such as lovers appreciate, and
the girl finally concluded that that must be his naturally
decided manner when suddenly approached on a subject
to which he could not consent. Elizabeth was aware that
there was little consideration shown her at such times, but
was resolved not to find fault unless the question were a
vital one. Altogether it was a happy day. Gratitude
was a large feature of Elizabeth&#8217;s make-up, and there was
something about being in the atmosphere of refinement
and beauty which made her accept many little evidences
of inattentiveness on the part of her husband. As she
helped with the cooking, she was conscious of the difference
between the kitchen utensils of this and her own
home; as she swept she contrasted the red-and-green ingrain
carpet of the sitting room with the worn and ugly
rag carpet of her mother&#8217;s house; as she set the table she
reflected that no other house of that community boasted
a dining room, and certainly no other young wife could
say she had napkins and a white tablecloth every day in
the week; and there was yet a larger item than these for
which the girl was thankful: no girl she had ever known
had married so cultured a man. Elizabeth looked across
the table as she served the pie at dinner and in spite of
every snub was humbly thankful to be a part of that
family. Nor was she a mere snob and deserving of what
she got in the way of ill treatment because she submitted
to it; Elizabeth was a young girl of artistic temperament,
craving beauty, and longing for the companionship of
those who talked in terms comprehensible to her at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
same time that they advanced her æsthetic education and
possibilities. In proportion as she valued this thing was
she to pay her price.</p>
<p>The price Elizabeth was to pay came at strange and
unexpected moments. The hired man, when he appeared,
proved to be Jake Ransom, now a man, and ready to do a
man&#8217;s work in his simple station. Jake of course knew
for whom he was to work and came into the kitchen to his
first meal with his face wreathed in a sheepish grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better &#8217;a&#8217; taken your advice an&#8217; gone t&#8217; th&#8217; high
school,&#8221; he said, extending his calloused hand to shake.
&#8220;Only I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been workin&#8217; fur you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed his great hearty guffaw, partly in embarrassment
and partly because he really enjoyed the joke of
the possibility of him being an educated man. It was a
cheap country pleasantry, and said with genuine good-fellowship,
but Mrs. Hunter, who heard it as she turned
to the dining room with the coffee pot in her hand, disapproved
of the familiarity of it. Mrs. Hunter had disapproved
of the plate laid for Jake at the family table and
was out of sorts with the country life into which she had
been plunged.</p>
<p>After Jake had gone to bed upstairs&mdash;and that was
another grievance of Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s, this having the hired
man in the room next to her own&mdash;she took up the matter
of his position in her son&#8217;s house seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the hired help in the country eat at the table and
are accorded the privileges of any member of the family,
mother,&#8221; John replied to her objections.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that You&#8217;ll have to have them at your
table day after day&mdash;always?&#8221; his mother exclaimed.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll never have any home life at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as we farm, mother, we&#8217;ll be in exactly
that position,&#8221; John said, stirring the fire in the sitting-room
stove, about which they were gathered for the
evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they eat so awfully much,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter continued,
&#8220;and they drink out of their saucers, and suck
their teeth till it makes one sick!&#8221; Then happening to
look across at Elizabeth she caught the flush on her young
face and stopped so short that all were embarrassed.</p>
<p>John got up suddenly and left the room and the house.
The two women sat in an uncomfortable silence for some
minutes, and then the elder of them went upstairs to bed,
leaving the younger to her mortifying thoughts. Elizabeth
remembered the scorn of the young teacher in her
own childhood for the same offence and reflected that she
had been unable to break her family of similar habits.
As far as she was concerned, however, the presence of the
hired man at her table was far less disturbing than that of
her husband&#8217;s mother. Part of the time she was happy
to learn from Mrs. Hunter, but more of the time she was
restless under her supervision.</p>
<p>The week had been an uncomfortable one in both
tangible and intangible ways. Elizabeth had often found
John and his mother talking and have them drop the
conversation when she appeared. She had had many
humiliating hours over the disgrace she knew they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
discussing. The fact had come out that Mr. Farnshaw
had returned to his home, but nothing beyond that.</p>
<p>Another week passed, and again John refused to take
Elizabeth to see Aunt Susan. This time he said that the
team had worked all week, and that he felt that the horses
needed rest. A new team was added to the farm assets
and the next Sunday John said he was too tired himself
to go away from home. Never once did he say that he
had any motive which extended beyond the time at hand.
Each Sunday the excuse fitted the circumstances of that
particular day, and he talked of going in a general way as
if it were a matter of course that they would go soon.
It was clearly the duty of the young couple to make the
first visit, and as clearly Nathan Hornby and his wife were
waiting for them to do so. Elizabeth was puzzled by her
husband&#8217;s refusal. At the end of a month she became
alarmed for fear their neglect would give offence to the
dear couple who had sheltered her when she was in need.
It had not occurred to her to discredit John&#8217;s reasons,
though she began to suspect that she had married the sort
of man she had heard much about&mdash;the husband who
never wanted to go anywhere.</p>
<p>Early in December Mrs. Hunter was called East by the
serious illness of a sister in Illinois. The day she left a
heavy snow fell. Elizabeth went out into the still yard
and let the white flakes fall on her uncovered head with
such a sense of freedom as she had never felt since her
marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The house is mine,&#8221; she whispered ecstatically; &#8220;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
house is all mine, and now I can go out of doors if I want
to and not be criticised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had been far more accustomed to barn life
than the life of the house. This was a thing that Mrs.
Hunter could not understand. It was not the correct
thing for a woman to go about the barn where a hired man
was employed, even if her husband worked at his side, and
Elizabeth&#8217;s trips to the cow stable and granaries had been
discouraged. Jake Ransom had been shrewd enough to
see that his first joke in the Hunter house had been unpleasant
to the mother of his employer and had never
trespassed upon the grounds of familiarity again, but
Elizabeth had been criticised until willing to give up her
trips to the scene of her husband&#8217;s work. John might be
impatient, but Elizabeth loved him; his mother was patient
but critical, and Elizabeth did not love her; therefore the
first feeling of relief when the older woman had gone away
included the delight of being free to go where she wished&mdash;at
his side. The barns were a source of great interest to
Elizabeth. The pride of the girl, accustomed to straw
stables and slatternly yards and unhoused machinery,
in the well-kept barnyard of her husband was natural
and commendatory. John had order well developed in
his scheme of things. John&#8217;s cribs did not stand open to
the weather. Now that Mrs. Hunter was away, Elizabeth
spent most of the day going about the place, looking
into every bin, and making the acquaintance of each new
animal they possessed. Jake was helping Silas and it left
the girl plenty of time to explore. The amount of new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
stock struck her as surprising. Here too she was glad.
John was evidently going to be a man of large affairs.
Elizabeth had a sudden desire to run over and talk it over
with Luther as she had done when she drove out with her
affianced husband to buy the calves. She was surprised
to see how the little bunch of calves had grown, not only
in size but in numbers. The thought of Luther carried
her back, as she stood looking over the calf yard, to the
matter of visiting Aunt Susan. Of late the feeling had
grown strong upon her that Mrs. Hunter had had something
to do with John&#8217;s reluctance to making this visit.
The calves ceased to interest her and she wandered slowly
back to the house thinking about it. There were so many
phases of her domestic affairs to consider: Aunt Susan&#8217;s
right to the evidences of her love and her inability to show
that love because of her husband&#8217;s reluctance to take
her; Luther&#8217;s evident offence, and the possibility that the
wedding invitation had not been extended to him by John,
since he had never paid them a neighbourly visit; the close
alliance between John and his mother and the brusqueness
with which John disposed of any request of hers if he did
not choose of himself to do the thing she wanted&mdash;all
called for examination. Elizabeth shook the snow from
her hair and cloak and built up the fire, intending to sit
down by it and think over her situation, but John arrived
in the middle of her preparations and supper had to be
hastily prepared, for the afternoon had gone and much
of the regular morning&#8217;s work still remained to be done.
With flying feet, Elizabeth attacked the task of getting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
things in order, and it was a relief when John, who had
left the last chores to Jake, came in and helped her. They
had hardly ever been left alone in the house in all the three
months they had been married, and to Elizabeth it was
working in fairyland to have John make one side of a bed&#8217;s
clothes lie smooth while she pulled and straightened at
the other.</p>
<p>With Mrs. Hunter gone, John took up the task of
drilling his young wife in the Hunter ways. To Elizabeth
he was a model husband. She contrasted her father&#8217;s
stupid inability and unwillingness inside of his home with
the orderly and systematic way in which John Hunter
helped her. John took part in whatever household function
was taking place in his presence. He wiped the
dishes if she washed them; if a carpet was to be swept he
handled the broom if he were there to do it, and he never
went to the field without filling the reservoir and water
pail as well as the coal scuttle and cob basket. He assumed
the management of cooking and housework so
subtly that the unsophisticated girl saw only his helpfulness;
in fact, he had only helpfulness in mind. John had
ideas of neatness and order which made of housekeeping
a never-ending process, but John himself laboured steadily
toward their accomplishment, and he was so successful in
inspiring her with those same ideals that her pride helped
her over many a weary day&#8217;s cleaning. She entered into
them week after week and became expert at ironing, baking,
and all the little offices of the domestic altar. All
her strength was given to her work each day, and for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
time she succeeded comfortably, but as the days shortened
and the routine became more exacting she longed for the
out-of-door freedom in which she had been raised.</p>
<p>Christmas passed, and still Elizabeth had entered no
house except her own since her marriage in October. This
would not have disturbed her, for she was not a girl who
cared for visiting, if it had not been that Aunt Susan was
being neglected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw came and did not fail to let Elizabeth
know that the country gossips were concerned with tales
supposed to account for her secluded way of living. Some
said that she was too &#8220;stuck-up&#8221; to associate with her old
friends, while others said that John Hunter had married
her to keep his house, but that he was not proud of her
and preferred to leave her at home. Luther had completed
his &#8220;shanty,&#8221; and Elizabeth knew by the smoke she could
see rising from his chimney that he no longer lived with
Aunt Susan; also Elizabeth heard bits of gossip about him
from Jake, who had taken a great liking to Luther and
often spent his evenings with him. Luther Hansen had
come to borrow a scoop shovel when he had shelled his
corn, but John had managed to accept it as a barnyard
call and had not invited him to the house, and after the
scoop was returned Luther did not come again. Elizabeth
had days when she wanted his cheery presence and
sensible ways of looking at life, but she was almost glad
he did not come; she could not have explained her seclusion
to him nor could she have refused to explain. The
girl&#8217;s pride was cut to the quick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>January passed, and February. One afternoon in early
March Elizabeth sat at the dining-room window sewing
and meditating sadly upon John&#8217;s growing irritability
whenever she mentioned Aunt Susan. She was unable as
yet to force him to take her as she requested; neither had
she been able to get her own consent to going the first time
to the house of this old friend alone and have Aunt Susan&#8217;s
questioning eyes looking her over for explanations. She
was puzzled still, for John usually spoke of her friends
with respect, and there was nothing to indicate his reasons
for opposition except that he was simply averse to visiting
on general principles, and even then why should he so
resolutely refuse to accommodate her when he was so
reasonable on all other subjects?</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;m going this week if he&#8217;s ever so cross,&#8221;
she muttered.</p>
<p>Almost at the same instant she looked up and saw a
bobsled coming into the side lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Susan&#8217;s very self!&#8221; she cried, pushing away the
little garment on which she was sewing, and running to
the door.</p>
<p>She met the muffled figure halfway down the path,
called to Nathan to take his team to the barn, where they
would be out of the cutting wind, and bundled Susan
Hornby into the house with little shrieks of delight and
welcome.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby knew that she was wanted at the end
of that five minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;However could you know that I was wanting you so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
bad to-day?&#8221; Elizabeth said finally, as she thrust her
guest down into a rocking chair and then went down on
her knees to unfasten her overshoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes! What are you trying to do&mdash;and
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The sentence stopped and the speaker looked
embarrassed.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, still on her knees, looked up. A soft blush
covered her face as she gave a happy little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it&#8217;s true,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Oh, Aunt Susan,
I&#8217;m so happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside, Nathan Hornby seized the opportunity to look
around the barns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good cattle sheds,&#8221; he remarked to himself. &#8220;Good
bunch of pigs, too. I hope &#8217;e ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; into debt, as they
say, but I swan, it looks like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan&#8217;s survey of the barns had given the two women
inside the house time to talk over the affair so close to their
hearts, and the little sitting room had been turned into a
temple by the presence of a young mother that was to be
and that older but childless mother who loved her as her
own. Elizabeth, still on her knees, laid her head in Aunt
Susan&#8217;s lap as of old, and Susan Hornby, with every hurt
buried, listened to her confessions, with her free hand feeling
its way over the thick braids as she prayed earnestly
in her heart that her beloved child would go through the
travail awaiting her without harm and not be left childless
in her old age.</p>
<p>When Nathan&#8217;s heavy boot crunched on the snow-covered
doorstep, Elizabeth ran to meet him with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
broom and a whole world&#8217;s wealth of welcome in voice
and manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you came to-day. I&#8217;ve been wanting
Aunt Susan <i>so</i> of late. Isn&#8217;t it a heavy snow for this late
in the season?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rattled busily along to carry the impress of welcome,
for the old man had not responded to her as his wife had
done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said candid Nathan, &#8220;you don&#8217;t exactly
give one th&#8217; impression of pinin&#8217; t&#8217; see folks when you never
come over at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew that though he regarded the broom with
which he brushed at his boots with extra attention, he was
listening closely for her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s John!&#8221; she cried, seeing her husband as he
drove a bunch of calves into the lane. She hastened to tell
her guest that her husband had been some miles to the
west to attend a sale, and pretended to have forgotten
Nathan&#8217;s awkward remark.</p>
<p>She was glad to see that John left Jake to turn the
calves into the yards and came to the house at once, with
cordiality shining out of every line of his face. He made
Nathan Hornby so welcome that every sign of displeasure
faded from Nathan&#8217;s countenance. He gave a hasty brush
at his boots and came in to shake hands with Susan Hornby.
He stirred the fire briskly, and remarked to Nathan:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that a dandy bunch of calves? I had a chance
to get them at that Irishman&#8217;s sale&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;oh,
yes, Tim&mdash;Tim&mdash;you know? I ought to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
myself since I just signed a note to him. Averaged
eighteen dollars a head&mdash;forty-three of &#8217;em. With corn
at thirty cents, they&#8217;ll turn quick money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fire roared under his vigorous poking, and he applied
himself to putting more coal in the stove without
looking up.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s face lost the happy expression with
which she had been regarding him as he welcomed the
old couple and stirred the fire, presumably for their benefit.
He <i>had</i> been glad to see them: they had helped him
over an awkward announcement. He had not told her
he meant to get these cattle, and he had let her think that
he meant to take her advice and not go into debt any more
than he had already done.</p>
<p>John Hunter heard his wife&#8217;s low exclamation of surprise.
He was glad it was over.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby heard it too and caught the sick look on
her face, but though she wondered about it she asked no
questions, for Elizabeth Hunter was a woman of reserve.
Elizabeth Hunter had developed a power unknown to
Elizabeth Farnshaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a good many sheds built a&#8217;ready, I see,&#8221; was the
next remark the girl heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; John replied, still devoting himself to the fire.
&#8220;I expected to get the stock sooner&mdash;haven&#8217;t used it all
this year&mdash;but it&#8217;s there for next season. I&#8217;ve got about
all the cattle I&#8217;ll get now. I told Carter I&#8217;d take seventeen
head of his. He was going to put them up at his sale
next week, but I persuaded him to let me have them in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
bunch. I&#8217;ll get them home to-morrow. Got &#8217;em on 6
per cent. They&#8217;ll grow into money every day this summer&mdash;mostly
two-year-olds. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all owin&#8217;,&#8221; Nathan replied slowly. &#8220;Cattle
take a lot of cover, an&#8217; you ain&#8217;t usin&#8217; straw sheds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my sheds ain&#8217;t cost so very much,&#8221; John replied
easily. &#8220;They&#8217;re substantial too. I don&#8217;t think much
of the straw-shed business. It&#8217;ll do for Hansen, now, that
ain&#8217;t got anything to put under cover, but when a man&#8217;s
got anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; John filled out the sentence with an
expressive gesture, and then before any one could speak
said casually: &#8220;By the way, I hear the Swede&#8217;s going to
be married to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Married?&#8221; Elizabeth Hunter exclaimed. Every word
of the conversation had been a stab, but to have Luther
called a Swede was too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; Aunt Susan said, laying a hand on her
arm. &#8220;I meant to have told you and I hadn&#8217;t got to it
yet. Nate and I are invited to the wedding. It&#8217;s Sadie
Crane, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth fell into the nearest chair utterly limp.
&#8220;Sadie Crane?&#8221; she said over and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d hate to have it Sadie, but any woman
could be glad to get a man as good as Luther, and she&#8217;s
crazy over him. He&#8217;ll make her a good husband whether
she makes a good wife or not. She&#8217;ll have her own way
a good deal further than most wives.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter suspected that the latter was said for his
benefit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>Nathan and Susan Hornby disagreed, as much as it was
possible for them to do, on the way home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may say what you please, if she don&#8217;t come it&#8217;s
because she don&#8217;t want to. You couldn&#8217;t ask for a more
rousin&#8217; welcome &#8217;n <i>he</i> give us,&#8221; Nathan said as he watched
the forefoot on the off horse to see whether it was a cake
of snow that made it limp or a more serious trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t any more rousing than hers was when I
went in and&mdash;and look how he spoke of Luther,&#8221; Susan
replied hesitatingly. She hardly dare point out the weakness
of John, however angry she was at him, for she had
had trouble enough to get Nathan to bring her at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Nathan admitted. &#8220;They&#8217;re a pair of
snobs, anyhow. You think she treats you all right, but
you saw how she shied round th&#8217; subject when I put
it straight to &#8217;er. I went because you wanted me to&mdash;but
I ain&#8217;t sure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Nathan Hornby ceased to
speak before his sentence was finished. Elizabeth&#8217;s neglect
had been another nail in the coffin of his friendly trust.
Susan had had hard work to persuade him to bring her
to-day and had hoped that some lucky circumstance
would help to dispel his suspicions. This had looked
possible at first, but she saw that he still nursed his
grievances.</p>
<p>Susan had her suspicions also, but they were of John,
not of Elizabeth. Elizabeth had been as glad to see her
as she had always been, whatever there might have been
that was unexplainable on the surface. Susan Hornby
knew with a knowledge that was unassailable that Elizabeth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
Hunter loved her as much as Elizabeth Farnshaw
had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;m going again some day before long,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;she won&#8217;t be going out much now for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, look here,&#8221; Nathan said, stubbornly sticking
to a conviction from which he was unable to get away.
&#8220;You think Hunter keeps her from coming. He give us
more of a welcome &#8217;n she did, a good sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby glanced around at her husband in astonishment.
She had never said that she thought Elizabeth
was prevented by John from coming to see them. Nathan
had measured her better than she had realized.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she replied slowly. She resolved to
speak frankly. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t see her when she took me
into the house. Honestly, Nate, it was better than
a whole revival service to have that girl tell me of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see that,&#8221; Nathan interrupted, &#8220;I only know
he <i>was</i> glad t&#8217; see us; you saw that for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Susan considered a
moment and then said firmly: &#8220;He was glad to see us
because there was something about those cattle he hadn&#8217;t
told her. Didn&#8217;t you see the look on her face?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t make no difference with th&#8217; way he&#8217;d
do by us. &#8217;E was as glad as could be, an&#8217; asked you t&#8217;
come back &#8217;s if you&#8217;d been &#8217;is mother. It&#8217;s some stuck-up
notion of hers&mdash;this thing of them not visitin&#8217; their
neighbours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan looked up at him indulgently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t refuse to be good friends with her&mdash;for
my sake, Nate. She was as glad to see me as a little
child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t she come t&#8217; see you then?&#8221; Nathan asked
sternly, able only to see the one point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know, Nate. I couldn&#8217;t crowd her
on that matter&mdash;she looked so worried when I brought
it up that I just let it go. I only <i>know</i> she wants to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>They dropped the subject and rode along over the
smooth road, too absorbed in their own thoughts to get
pleasure out of this last sleighride of the season, both endeavoring
to solve the problem from their own viewpoint,
Nathan full of distrust and suspicion, his wife too well
versed in human nature to doubt Elizabeth&#8217;s honesty or
believe that she was spoiled by a fine home or an advanced
social position. At last she spoke her conclusions:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in her face I like better&#8217;n ever, but
there&#8217;s a worried something there I don&#8217;t like to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan was sorry he had criticised Elizabeth. Sue
loved the girl. Nathan and Susan discussed, but never
argued. If Susan remained of her first opinion after talking
a thing over, Nathan conceded within himself that she
had some good reason for her convictions even where he
could not agree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sue &#8217;ll have t&#8217; see it for herself,&#8221; he meditated. &#8220;I&#8217;d
be glad t&#8217; see &#8217;er right. We&#8217;ll see how it turns out.&#8221; But
as he tried to get himself into that frame of mind he remembered
how many days had been spoiled for his wife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
that winter because she longed for Elizabeth, and he
involuntarily muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dirty little huzzy!&#8221; and ground his straggling teeth
as he thought of it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>After Nathan and Susan Hornby had turned into the
main road, John walked slowly back to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d I say that Mrs. Hornby didn&#8217;t like?&#8221; he asked,
as he entered the kitchen where Elizabeth was preparing
the supper which Nathan had declined to stay and eat.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s brow was drawn into a puckered wrinkle.
She followed her own laborious thinking, unaware that
her husband had spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d I say that riled Mrs. Hornby?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>Elizabeth heard the question now and looked up. It
was hard to answer. To mention the tone in which he
had spoken of Luther was useless she knew. Her hesitancy
annoyed her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Elizabeth could not discuss
it.</p>
<p>John Hunter resented her silence. He turned without
speaking and picked up the water pail quickly. John
heaped coals of fire by performing household duties.</p>
<p>Reflecting that he was going to be angry whether she
talked out or not, Elizabeth laid a detaining hand on his
arm and spoke of what she felt she could get his attention
fixed upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of all that money we&#8217;re going to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
to pay some day, John. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve tried before to make
you understand me. Oh, John, dear, don&#8217;t you see&mdash;but
then, no, of course you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ve never had the experience
of it. You see, dear, I&#8217;ve had it. It takes the
heart out of people. You never get rid of it after you
get into it once. You just go on, you get old and quarrelsome&mdash;and&mdash;and
you never have any good times because
you&#8217;re afraid of something&mdash;of the interest that&#8217;s
got to be met, and things. Why won&#8217;t you let me help
you? You didn&#8217;t tell me about these last cattle, nor the
Carter lot. Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, Elizabeth, a man can&#8217;t run to the
house and consult a woman about every little thing he
does, before he does it. I always tell you when I can. I
told you about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Irritability was John Hunter&#8217;s strongest weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to run to the house to tell me about
every little thing you do,&#8221; the young wife explained
patiently, &#8220;but these debts will not be little things when
they come to be paid off, dear. Really, you don&#8217;t know
how they will sap you and me later on; they may even
take the farm right out from under our feet. There are
so many things that can happen to cattle&mdash;and interest
<i>has</i> to be paid. That&#8217;s the awful part of it, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>John fidgeted uneasily and did not look at her. He
wanted to get away. He had not come in to talk of this.
Elizabeth held his sleeve and he had to say something.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t failed to get what you need out of this
money,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I can&#8217;t have you shutting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
opportunities for business. I&#8217;ll raise the interest. If I
furnish the money I ought to be free to make a living the
best way I see how. What do you know about a man&#8217;s
business?&#8221;</p>
<p>Desiring only to convince him, which she could not do
if he were irritated, Elizabeth laid her paring knife on the
kitchen table and put her arm about her husband&#8217;s neck
coaxingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you get everything I need, dear; that isn&#8217;t
the trouble. I don&#8217;t want to shut out opportunities for
business either, but I gave up my education to help pay
interest. I know how hard it is to raise. The calves die,
and the cows don&#8217;t give milk enough to make up the difference.
The loss&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I know,&#8221; she said putting
her hand affectionately over his mouth to still the objection
he had started to offer. &#8220;You think beef cattle will
be different, but black-leg gets into a herd of beef cattle
just as readily as into the cows and calves, and frosted
corn is a liability Kansas farmers always have hanging
over a crop. I&#8217;m not complaining about the cattle that
are paid for&mdash;it&#8217;s those we&#8217;d have to pay for that were
dead. The money was yours and you had a right to spend
it as you chose, but the debts will be <i>ours</i>. The skimping
and saving will fall on me as much as on you, and skimping
makes people mean and penurious. Promise me you
won&#8217;t go into debt without telling me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, little woman,&#8221; John replied, patting her
face and kissing it many times. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never do anything
to disgrace you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>He had not replied to a single argument; he had not
made a single promise. Elizabeth submitted to his
caresses with a sigh. It was useless. She could not fall
out with him for the sake of the child that was coming.
She resolved to accept what she could get and try to be
patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you were so nice to Aunt Susan,&#8221; she said,
trying to get away from the impossible and make as much
as she could out of the possible. &#8220;we&#8217;ll go over Sunday.
I&#8217;d begun to think you&#8217;d never do it. We&#8217;ll take them
by surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter laughed indulgently. &#8220;You think you
got me that time,&#8221; he said, and escaped to the well without
further remark.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked after him, and pondered, with a quivering
lip, on the wilfulness of the refusal to promise. She
had been so sure that she was escaping the hell of mortgages
and interest when she married. The farm was
already carrying every cent the loan companies would
give on first papers. If anything should happen to the
stock they would have to put a second mortgage on part
of it. John was determined to work on a large scale.
She had tried many times to show him how hard it would
be to raise large incumbrances, but whenever she did so
he became fretful and for days spoiled the home comfort
for which she strove. Elizabeth tried to model their
home life after that of Aunt Susan, and leave her husband
free to use his own judgment, but this matter of indebtedness
was alarming. She knew how slowly money came in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
on the farm and how impossible it was to raise a mortgage
once it was plastered over a piece of land. Already she
saw the day of payments, note-renewals, and chattel
mortgages staring them in the face. Elizabeth&#8217;s pride
had suffered a fall. She saw the weary years stretch
ahead of them without joy and without hope other than
that which those about them had, unless some special
providence assisted them to avoid the common lot of
farmers. As she went about her table-setting, however,
the quality of the linen, of the dishes, of every object in
the room differed from anything she had ever known, and
the hope of youth came to her aid. This home should be
different from the rest; she would make it so by patience
as well as by its possessions. The black-leg was not an
immediate danger, and she would look for the best.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Winter passed, and spring. The patience Elizabeth had
vowed to command had been tried to the utmost in some
particulars. John had never taken her to see Aunt Susan.
Sometimes he said &#8220;wait till next week,&#8221; sometimes he
said he was tired, more often he retired into his accustomed
irritability, and at last because of the evidences of
her pregnant state she ceased to desire it. The winter
had not been totally unpleasant. If she did not irritate
her husband they were very happy together. John had
pleasant little ways about the house and was as helpful as
the most exacting woman could demand. The spring
had been harder because Elizabeth had less strength and
the house and garden work had increased. It took three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
hired men to keep the farm work done, and there were
many mouths to fill.</p>
<p>One particularly hot day in June John unloaded on the
kitchen table an armful of groceries he had just brought
from town, remarking as he did so:</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought home some dried blackberries for pies,
Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsie Brown, the lately acquired hired girl, stood at
Elizabeth&#8217;s elbow, and began to put the parcels away in
the cupboard.</p>
<p>Elizabeth took a couple of letters he was handing her
and went into the sitting room to read them. John followed
her in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure you make the pies,&#8221; he said with an emphasis
which showed he meant to have it remembered.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better cook the fruit to-night,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll tell Hepsie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better do it yourself,&#8221; he cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can do it. I&#8217;ll tell her,&#8221; Elizabeth said without
looking up, but she knew that that would not end the
discussion the moment it was out of her mouth. She
recognized John&#8217;s most unpleasant insisting mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always tends to her own pie-baking. Girls
never get things right,&#8221; he said emphatically, waiting for
her to raise her eyes to his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, dear,&#8221; the girl answered, looking up as he
required. &#8220;She can do it just as well as I can; it don&#8217;t
hurt her to stand on her feet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>She had given the sign of submission and he was ready
to be pleasant about it, but he reiterated the demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, dear,&#8221; he said, kissing her, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t bear
to have things coming on the table not right when we have
men about. It don&#8217;t take long to make a few pies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth rose wearily, put the letters down and went
to the kitchen. Her face was drawn and there was a
fagged, weary droop to the shoulders. John demanded
that the house and cooking be kept up to the city standard,
forgetting that there was a garden to keep in order
also, besides little chickens to feed and butter to be made.
If Elizabeth had said she were sick and had gone to bed,
John would have had the doctor come to see her twice as
often as necessary, and would have exhausted the little
town of Colebyville to supply such things as she could eat,
but it never occurred to John Hunter that as long as his
wife was able to go about the house that she might know
what she should do much better than he.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was unable to defend herself. She coveted
peace, and she could not have peace unless she responded
to John&#8217;s suggestions. Also, at this time Elizabeth was
determined that she would not be cross. The coming
child absorbed her mind as much as it absorbed her body.
She would not let one hour of discord or inharmony affect
its life. Elizabeth had no idea how to manage her husband
so as to get him even to listen to her side of an
argument. The girl was worn out by useless things which
she could not avoid doing.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was extremely nervous at this period of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
life. John went to bed full of healthy fatigue and slept
soundly till morning, and knew nothing of mental and
physical strains which left his wife more tired in the morning
than when she went to bed at night. Elizabeth had
been a strong girl, but she was supporting the life of
another; she tossed and moaned through the two or three
short hours in which she could sleep, and for the rest lay
wide-eyed, staring into the darkness, filled with terror at
what the rapidly approaching future held for her. In her
girlish imaginings and fears, ignorant of the facts a young
mother should have known, she had magnified the sufferings
of childbirth till life was a network of horrors, and
her nerves were at the breaking point.</p>
<p>The next morning Elizabeth, with aching back and
trembling knees, her face flushed from the heat of the
stove, stood at the kitchen table rolling out the pie crust.
A tear rolled down her cheek. Hepsie, who stood near
and was regarding her sympathetically, laid firm hold on
the rolling-pin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d no business t&#8217; do it. Now you go in an&#8217;
set down in th&#8217; rockin&#8217; chair while I finish this here batch
of pies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsie was older than Elizabeth and making pies had
been her business; the crust was mixed and the fruit had
been cooked the night before. Reflecting that not much
could happen to a pie after getting that far on the road
to perfection, Elizabeth let the rolling-pin be taken from
her hand and went in wearily to throw herself on the
lounge to rest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>John came into the kitchen and his face darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Mrs. Hunter that I look for Hansen to help with
the grain to-day, and that I told him to bring his wife
with him,&#8221; he said to Hepsie, and went out, banging the
door after him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had heard him come in and had risen to explain,
but stopped short when she heard that Luther had
been asked to help. Her first feeling was of a joy which
brought the tears to her eyes. John had been persistently
cool whenever Luther had been mentioned since their
marriage. The next feeling of which she was conscious
was an intense distaste to having Sadie in the house with
her all day, and this was followed by the thought that
John had known that Luther and Sadie were coming since
the day before and had said nothing about it to her; but
small time was given her to think about any phase of the
matter, for Luther&#8217;s familiar, unpainted wagon was at
that very moment coming into the side lane. With a
conviction that she had not been told till it was absolutely
necessary, Elizabeth walked promptly out to meet her
young neighbours.</p>
<p>It was the old Luther which greeted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my wife, Lizzie,&#8221; he said with such a happy
look in Sadie&#8217;s direction that Elizabeth&#8217;s heart responded
to the call for open friendship. Luther never nursed
suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should just say I did,&#8221; Elizabeth replied warmly,
extending her hand to the little woman Luther was setting
on her feet. Luther climbed promptly into the high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
seat from which he had just lifted his wife and held his
own hand down to Elizabeth from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was mighty fine for you to send word for her t&#8217;
come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Elizabeth did not let him gather from any hint of
expression or word that so far from sending word for
Sadie to spend the day with her, she had not known till
in these last ten minutes that either of them was expected.
John came and talked to Luther, mounting the
spring-seat at his side to ride to the field, but did not look
at Elizabeth, though she looked at him longingly and
everything in her cried out for reconciliation and openness.
John had a way of ignoring her when explanations had to
be made.</p>
<p>Luther&#8217;s attitude toward his wife had influenced Elizabeth
in Sadie&#8217;s favour as nothing else had ever been able
to do. She began to feel less hostile, and as they turned
toward the house asked her interestedly how she was
&#8220;coming on&#8221; with her garden and chickens. This was
common ground, and Sadie warmed to the real welcome
she was accorded. She stopped beside Elizabeth&#8217;s coops
in the backyard and examined the little groups of begging,
downy balls with the animation of a true farmer&#8217;s wife.
Here was something she knew as well as Elizabeth; in fact,
when a count was made it was discovered that Sadie&#8217;s
broods several times outnumbered those of the neighbour
she envied. It was an absorbing topic of conversation,
and the two women stood for some moments with
the hungry little beggars clamouring lustily about them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Suddenly they became conscious of the smell of burning
sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my goodness!&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed, and ran to
the kitchen, leaving her guest to follow as she chose.</p>
<p>Hepsie had gone upstairs, and as Elizabeth opened the
oven door a cloud of smoke rolled out which nearly
blinded her and set her to coughing.</p>
<p>Sadie followed her in and somehow her mood changed
as she looked over the well-kept kitchen. Something in
the tidy order and tasty arrangement of its shelves hurt.
Sadie was not a natural housekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet she just thinks she beat us all,&#8221; she thought as
she laid her bonnet on the sitting-room sofa, where she
had felt of the pillows, and the lambrequin which hung
from the long shelf where the clock and vasts stood, on
the opposite side of the room. &#8220;Bet she don&#8217;t put on no
airs about me just the same.&#8221; She looked at the small
bookcase below the mantel in a perfect rage of envy.
Elizabeth was surrounded by the things which befitted
Elizabeth, and Sadie realized as she had never done in
their childhood the chasm which separated them, and
knew nothing of the anguish of the young wife as she
laboured with the disfigured pies, nor that Elizabeth
thought of the look of love she had seen Sadie receive
with something very like envy in her heart.</p>
<p>Elizabeth thought long upon the joy in Luther&#8217;s face as
he greeted her. John must have made some move about
the request for help which covered the neglect of all these
months adequately to Luther. Sadie finished her inspection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
of the inner regions and returned to the kitchen
primed with things to be said to her rival, and Elizabeth
fared badly at her hands. Her innate refinement would
not let Elizabeth strike back in the coarse way in which
she was attacked, and she listened to hints and pretended
sympathy on the subject of Farnshaw domestic difficulties,
of reported debts which John Hunter had contracted, and
neighbourhood estimates of the fact of her own secluded
manner of life since her marriage, till her head swam and
her memory was scorched for many a day. But though
her head ached and her knees almost refused to perform
their office, Elizabeth remained in the kitchen and superintended
every dish prepared for that harvest dinner.
The fact that the pies had scorched left her with the feeling
that John had had a foundation of real fact for his
demand that she give them her personal attention, and
left her humbled and ready to beg forgiveness. Every
fibre of her cried out for the trust she had seen in Luther&#8217;s
glance at Sadie. <i>There</i> was true marriage, and the state
which she laboured daily to establish.</p>
<p>At dinner John did not look at Elizabeth, though her
eyes sought his constantly, and when the pie was passed
around she remarked on its trimmed edges shamefacedly.</p>
<p>Silas Chamberlain wiped his knife on a piece of bread
and slid it under the section nearest him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never mind about them edges. It looks like a
good pie t&#8217; me, an&#8217; John here will eat his share of it, I&#8217;ll
warrant you. Th&#8217; rest of this company can survive if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
does. I just been a thinkin&#8217; as I set here what a stunnin&#8217;
cook you&#8217;ve got t&#8217; be in these ten months. I used t&#8217; think
you&#8217;d have a lot t&#8217; learn after you was married, but you
seem t&#8217; &#8217;a&#8217; learned it short off&mdash;eh, John?&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter had to reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sorry mother
had to go away. Elizabeth&#8217;s done pretty well, but mother
would have been a great help, with her fixed ways of doing
things,&#8221; he said reluctantly.</p>
<p>Luther had been looking earnestly at John, but spared
Elizabeth when he saw her confusion by looking quickly
down at his plate and saying nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know&#8217;s Lizzie needs any help as far as doin&#8217;
things is concerned, though she may need more rest,&#8221;
Silas returned; and Sadie took up the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think my stove bakes a little better on the bottom,&#8221;
she remarked critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I low t&#8217; taste your pies to-morrow if it don&#8217;t rain,&#8221;
Silas answered her without looking up from the bite he was
severing with the knife upon which it was to be conveyed
to his mouth.</p>
<p>Luther Hansen&#8217;s laugh rang out heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, winking at Sadie. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be keepin&#8217;
me out of th&#8217; field t&#8217; fire th&#8217; oven.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sting of the criticism was drawn by Luther&#8217;s merry
acceptation of it. Sadie laughed too, but the hint left its
rankling point. These same men would harvest for them
on the morrow, and as Sadie looked over Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s
well set table she knew that she would not have the
advantage on her side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie&#8217;s always had th&#8217; best of everything,&#8221; she
thought.</p>
<p>Silas Chamberlain thought over the day&#8217;s events as he
rode slowly home. While unhitching, Old Queen nipped
angrily at Bob, who had sniffed at her collar pad, and
Silas cuffed her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, there, you spiteful beast! You&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217;
pie that&#8217;s a leetle better done on th&#8217; under crust next.
Drat &#8217;er! I could &#8217;a&#8217; fit right there, only&mdash;well you kin
allus hit harder with that kind of folks if you don&#8217;t let
yourself git riled. Pore little woman! Not little, neither&mdash;but
a year ago so young an&#8217; glowin&#8217; with happiness.
Used t&#8217; make me think of a bob-white, trottin&#8217; up an down
these roads s&#8217; contented like, an&#8217; allus so friendly an&#8217;
sociable. Looks &#8217;s if she didn&#8217;t have spirits enough t&#8217;
laugh at nothin&#8217; these days. Looks &#8217;s if she&#8217;d had a peep
into a den of wild beasts an&#8217; was afraid they&#8217;d break out
an&#8217; get &#8217;er. Liza Ann&#8217;s got t&#8217; go an&#8217; see &#8217;er, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
t&#8217; tell &#8217;er so.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Silas went toward the house, he stopped suddenly
and looked back at the wagon, which stood in the same
place he had left it that rainy afternoon over a year
ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked that peert with &#8217;er red lips an&#8217; bright eyes,
a askin&#8217; if th&#8217; school board was t&#8217; meet. Pore little
woman&mdash;she ain&#8217;t a goslin&#8217; any more, an&#8217; &#8217;er new feathers
ain&#8217;t turnin&#8217; th&#8217; rain very good neither,&#8221; he reflected,
shaking his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>The long day ended at last and John came to the
house after the evening chores were finished. Elizabeth
waited for him in her bedroom. Throughout the
entire evening she had been telling herself that she
must make this thing right. For the sake of the expected
child she must not let her mind be disturbed
with the hurt feeling she had been unable to put away
since John had gone out without letting her explain
about the morning&#8217;s baking. She allowed herself no
angry or resentful thought for the prolonged and
cruel reproach. Dry-eyed, she sat by the open window
in her nightdress, making buttonholes in a tiny slip
as she waited. She heard him deposit the basket of
cobs beside the kitchen stove, which he never forgot
to bring in at night, and by the rattle of the dipper
which followed and the chug, chug, chug of the pump
knew that he was filling the reservoir. Breakfast on
the farm was an early meal and greatly facilitated by
small preparations. John never forgot nor neglected
his part of the household duties. Elizabeth sighed.
John had the appearance of right on his side when
he demanded her highest efforts at the household altar.
She put away the little slip as she heard him coming
toward the bedroom and rose to meet him. The
tears came in spite of every effort to stay them, and to
hide her face she dug it deep into his shoulder while
she sobbed out her story. It was a full minute before
John&#8217;s arm went about her, but at last reflecting
that something was due one in her condition,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
he patted her heaving shoulders and said as if addressing
a child:</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there now, I never thought of you feeling so
bad,&#8221; and after a minute&#8217;s thought added, &#8220;but you see,
dear, the part of the dinner you saw to yourself was all
right, and the pies had to be apologized for.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;PORE LITTLE WOMAN&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Silas Chamberlain answered to a loud knock
on his door at the midnight hour. It was the first
week of August.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Hunter&#8217;s, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a mumbled conversation at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, of course. Come right in&mdash;glad t&#8217; have
you. When was you called&mdash;an hour an&#8217; a half ago?
Now you come right upstairs, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll have you in bed in
two shakes. There now&mdash;them covers&#8217;ll be too heavy, I
&#8217;spect, but you kin throw &#8217;em off if you don&#8217;t want &#8217;em.
Jest keep that light. I&#8217;ll git another downstairs. Good-night.
Oh, yes! Jake&#8217;s gone for th&#8217; doctor, you say?
Started an hour an&#8217; a half ago? Guess &#8217;e ain&#8217;t there yet&mdash;seven
mile you know. Well, good-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas stumbled down the steep stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liza Ann, it&#8217;s come! Pore little woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>He got back into bed and lay so still that his wife
thought him asleep. &#8220;Pore child!&#8221; she heard him say
just as she was drifting off to dreamland. An hour passed.
An hour and a half. There was the sound of wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s th&#8217; doctor, Liza Ann.&#8221; There was no reply.</p>
<p>The old man fidgeted for fifteen minutes more; he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
grown nervous. He slid out of the bed quietly and went
to the barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I heard a noise,&#8221; he told himself by way of
excuse for his action. &#8220;Wonder if Old Queen&#8217;s loose?&#8221;
He felt his way along the manger carefully. Unaccustomed
to midnight visitors, Queen snorted and shrank
from his hand when he touched her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, there! You needn&#8217;t be so blamed &#8217;fraid&mdash;nothin&#8217;s
goin&#8217; t&#8217; hurt you. You ain&#8217;t a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas found a nail-keg and sat down on it across from
the nibbling horses, and thought and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s there by this time,&#8221; he murmured presently.
&#8220;Wisht they&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; sent for Liza Ann. No, I guess it&#8217;s
better not. She wouldn&#8217;t know what t&#8217; do, havin&#8217; no
experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>He debated with himself as to whether he should go
back to bed or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;Lord! how long the
nights is when a feller&#8217;s awake!&#8221;</p>
<p>The horses ate on uninterruptedly and the soft breeze
stole through the old barn, while everything in nature was
indicative of peace except the old man, whose mind
worked relentlessly on the situation of the young wife
whose certain suffering racked him almost as much as if
he had stood in its presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh-a-livin&#8217;s!&#8221; he exclaimed as a new thought
struck him. &#8220;I wonder which one of &#8217;em Jake got.
Now that young Doc Stubbins ain&#8217;t got no more
sense &#8217;n a louse. I ought t&#8217; &#8217;a&#8217; told John an&#8217; I forgot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Lord! Lord! th&#8217; chances th&#8217; poor critters have t&#8217;
take!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chamberlain was awakened in the gray light of
morning as her husband crept shivering into bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you been?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out t&#8217; th&#8217; barn. Heard a noise an&#8217; thought I&#8217;d better
look into it,&#8221; was Silas&#8217;s reply.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As the sun rose the new life was ushered in. Doctor
Morgan did not start home till after nine o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is to have charge of your wife, Mr. Hunter?&#8221; he
asked as he paused in the door and looked back at his
patient anxiously. Seven miles was a long distance&mdash;and
she might need him suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought Hepsie and I could care for her,&#8221;
John replied. Trained nurses were unheard of in those
days.</p>
<p>&#8220;It simply cannot be,&#8221; answered the old man. (Doctor
Stubbins had not been engaged.) &#8220;Another attack like
this last one would&mdash;well, you <i>must</i> have some one of
experience here. It&#8217;s a matter of life or death&mdash;at
least it might be,&#8221; he added under his breath. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
you stay?&#8221; he asked Susan Hornby, who sat with the
baby on her knee. &#8220;The girl&#8217;s liable to slip away from
us before I could get here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was arranged that Aunt Susan should stay with the
young mother, who was too weak to turn her head on the
pillow it lay upon, for as the old doctor had said she was a
desperately sick girl. They had but just kept her with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
them. The presence of Aunt Susan was almost as
delightful to Elizabeth Hunter as the head of the child
on her arm. Weak and exhausted, she was permitted
such rest as she had not known in all the days of her
married life. The darkened room and the quiet of the
next three days were such a mercy to her tired nerves
that she would have been glad to lie there for ages. Doctor
Morgan let Susan Hornby return to her home and
husband at the end of the week, confident that with care,
Hepsie could perform the little offices required, but he was
to learn that country people have little judgment in
serious cases of illness, and that the young mother&#8217;s room
would be filled with company when he came out the next
day.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Crane were the first to arrive on Sunday
morning, and when John announced that they were driving
up to the hitching post, Elizabeth begged weakly for
him to say that she was too ill to see any one that day.
John would have been glad to deliver that message,
remembering the wedding day, but Sadie was with her
mother, and John had found Luther a convenient neighbour
of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t offend them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t have them. Please, John&mdash;with my
head aching already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so loud,&#8221; John said warningly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw came and had to have her team tied to
the barnyard fence. She walked to the house with the
rest of the company, and even in their presence could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
restrain her complaints because she had not been notified
of her daughter&#8217;s serious illness and the arrival of the child.
Elizabeth&#8217;s protest that they had been absorbed by that
illness, and too busy to think of anything but the most
urgent and immediate duties, did not quiet the objections,
for Mrs. Farnshaw had the habit of weak insistence. Her
mother&#8217;s whine was never so hard to bear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mr. Farnshaw?&#8221; Mr. Crane asked. &#8220;He&#8217;s
grandpa now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shrank into her pillows, and Mrs. Farnshaw
bridled angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s busy,&#8221; was her tart reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think he&#8217;d want t&#8217; see his grandson. Lizzie,
you haven&#8217;t showed me that boy,&#8221; Mr. Crane insisted.</p>
<p>And Elizabeth, weak and worn, had to draw the sleeping
child from under the quilts at her side and show him
off as if he had been a roll of butter at a country fair,
while constant reference was made to one phase or another
of the unpleasant things in her experience. Her colour
deepened and her head thumped more and more violently,
and by noon when they trooped out to the dining room,
where Hepsie had a good dinner waiting, the girl-wife was
worn out. She could not eat the food brought to her, but
drank constantly, and was unable to get a snatch of sleep
before the visitors assembled about her bed again.</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock Doctor Morgan arrived and Luther
Hansen came for Sadie. Sadie saw him drive in, and
laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther wasn&#8217;t a bit for comin&#8217;, but I told him I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
come over with ma, an&#8217; he could come after me. He&#8217;s
always chicken-hearted, an&#8217; said since Lizzie was so sick
we oughtn&#8217;t t&#8217; come. I don&#8217;t see as you&#8217;re s&#8217; sick, Lizzie;
you&#8217;ve got lots of good colour in your face, an&#8217; th&#8217; way
you pull that baby around don&#8217;t look much like you was
goin&#8217; t&#8217; kick the bucket just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no reply, but watched John help Doctor
Morgan tie his team.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Mrs. Hunter?&#8221; Doctor Morgan asked John as
he came around to the gate after the horses were fastened.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I guess. She&#8217;s had a good deal of company
to-day. I didn&#8217;t want them, but you can&#8217;t offend people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We usually have a good deal of company at a funeral,&#8221;
the old doctor said dryly, as he viewed the extra horses
and wagons about the fence.</p>
<p>When he entered the sickroom his face hardened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as much afraid of your neighbours as you are,
Mr. Hunter,&#8221; he said, and went to the middle door and
beckoned Luther to come with him into the yard. A few
words was all that was needed with Luther Hansen, and
the doctor returned to his patient.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Sadie was more sarcastic than usual as they drove home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; come if I&#8217;d a known I wasn&#8217;t wanted,&#8221;
she remarked sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Sadie, Doc Morgan says she&#8217;s worse! I&#8217;d turn
&#8217;em out quick enough if it was you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor little Sadie Hansen caught the spirit of the remark.
Nothing like it had ever before been offered her in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
her bitter, sensitive experience. She looked up at her
husband mollified, and let even Elizabeth have a season
of rest as she considered this astonishing thing which
marriage had brought to her.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby, who had thought her darling resting on
this quiet Sabbath day, was reëstablished at the bedside,
and it was not till the morning of the tenth day that she
again left the house. At the end of that time she was
dismissed reluctantly by the good old doctor himself. It
had been such a good excuse to be with Elizabeth that
Aunt Susan had persuaded the long-suffering Nathan that
her presence beside her was a thing not to be denied, and
Nathan, glad to see Sue so happy, ate many a cold meal
that haying season and did not complain. It was a great
event in Susan Hornby&#8217;s life. Gentle and cordial to all,
Susan Hornby lived much alone&mdash;alone most of all when
surrounded with her neighbours. Elizabeth was her only
real tie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, child! I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; she said one
day as she laid the beautiful brown head on Elizabeth&#8217;s
arm.</p>
<p>Elizabeth patted the hand that was drawing the little
white shawl over the baby&#8217;s head. Master John Hunter&mdash;the
babe had been named for its father&mdash;had had
his daily bath, and robed in fresh garments, and being
well fed and housed in the snuggest of all quarters, the
little triangle made by a mother&#8217;s arm, settled himself for
his daily nap, while the two women watched him with the
eyes of affection. Never again do we so nearly attain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
perfect peace in this turbulent life as during those first few
weeks when the untroubled serenity of human existence is
infringed upon by nothing but a desire for nourishment,
which is conveniently present, to be had at the first asking,
and which there is such a heaven of delight in obtaining.
We are told that we can only enter the Kingdom of Heaven
by becoming as little children: no other Kingdom of
Heaven is adequate after that.</p>
<p>The life in this little room had taken Susan Hornby back
to her own youth, and as often as otherwise when Master
John was being put through his daily ablutions it was the
little Katie of long ago that she bathed and robed fresh
and clean for the morning nap. At other times Elizabeth
was her Katie grown older. It was the flowering
time of Susan Hornby&#8217;s life. The fact that Elizabeth had
never crossed her threshold since her marriage to John
Hunter had faded out of Aunt Susan&#8217;s mind. Elizabeth&#8217;s
every word and look spoke the affection she felt for her.
Other people might sneer and doubt, but Susan Hornby
accepted what her instincts told her was genuine.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Elizabeth got about the house slowly. The days in bed
had been made tolerable by the presence of those she
loved, but she was far from strong, and she looked forward
with reluctance to the time when Aunt Susan would
not be with her. John complained of Hepsie&#8217;s work only
when with his wife alone, for Aunt Susan had been so
constant in her praises that he would not start a discussion
which he had found he brought out by such criticism.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>Susan Hornby looked on, and was as much puzzled as
ever about the relations of the young couple. Elizabeth
was evidently anxious about John&#8217;s opinions, but she
never by so much as a word indicated that they differed
from hers. She spoke of him with all the glow of her
early love; she pointed out his helpfulness as if he were the
only man in the world who looked after the kitchen affairs
with such exactitude; she would have the baby named for
no one else, and all her life and thought centred around
him in so evident a manner that Aunt Susan could not but
feel that she was the happiest of wives. She talked of her
ideals of harmony, of her thankfulness for the example of
the older woman&#8217;s life with her husband, of her desire to
pattern after that example, of everything that was good
and hopeful in her life, with so much enthusiasm as to
completely convince her friend that she had found a fitting
abiding place. And, indeed, Elizabeth believed all that
she said. Each mistake of their married life together had
been put away as a mistake. Each day she began in firm
faith in the possibility of bringing about necessary
changes. If she failed, she was certain in her own mind
that the failure had been due to some weakness of her own.
Never did man have a more patient, trusting wife than
John Hunter. There had been much company about the
house of late, and there had been no difficulties. Elizabeth
was not yet analytical enough to reason out that because
of the presence of that company far less demand had been
made upon her by her husband. She thought that they
were really getting on better than they had done, and told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
herself happily that it must be because she was more
rested than she had been and was therefore not so annoyed
by small things. It was ever Elizabeth&#8217;s way to
look for blame in herself. The baby was a great source
of pleasure also. He was a good child and slept in
the most healthy fashion, though beginning now when
awake to look about him a little and try to associate
himself with his surroundings. Elizabeth had begun to
look forward to Silas&#8217;s first visit with the child. Silas had
quaint ways with the young, and it was with very real
pleasure that she dragged herself to the door and admitted
him the first week she was out of bed. Elizabeth
led the old man to the lounge on tiptoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to see him, Mr. Chamberlain; you and he
are to be great friends,&#8221; she said as she went down on her
knees and drew the white shawl reverently from the sleeping
face. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a fine, big fellow?&#8221; she asked, looking
up at the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E ought t&#8217; be, havin&#8217; you for his mother,&#8221; Silas said
with an attempt at being witty, and looking at the baby
shyly.</p>
<p>The baby roused a little, and stretched and grunted,
baby fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lordie! what good sleep they do have!&#8221; Silas said,
holding out his finger to the little red hand extended
toward him, and then withdrawing it suddenly. &#8220;Now,
Liza Ann sleeps just like that t&#8217; this day.&#8221; He spoke
hesitatingly, as if searching for a topic of conversation.
&#8220;She does &#8217;er work regular like, an&#8217; she sleeps as regular as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
she works. I often think what a satisfyin&#8217; sort of life she
leads, anyhow. She tends t&#8217; &#8217;er own business an&#8217; she
don&#8217;t tend t&#8217; nobody else&#8217;s, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;she ain&#8217;t got no
more on &#8217;er mind &#8217;n that there baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth gathered the child into her arms and seated
herself in a rocking chair, while the old man sat stiffly
down on the edge of the lounge and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I ain&#8217;t that way, you know. I have a most
uncomfortable way of gettin&#8217; mixed up in th&#8217; affairs of
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s always a friendly interest,&#8221; Elizabeth interposed,
mystified by his curious manner and rambling
conversation.</p>
<p>Silas crossed his knees and, clasping his hands about the
uppermost one, rocked back and forth on the edge of the
lounge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most allus,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but not quite. Now I&#8217;m
fair ready t&#8217; fight that new Mis Hansen. I&#8217;ve been right
fond of Luther, for th&#8217; short time I&#8217;ve knowed &#8217;im, but
what he see in that there Sadie Crane&#8217;s beyond me. <i>He&#8217;s</i>
square. He looks you in th&#8217; face &#8217;s open &#8217;s day when he
talks t&#8217; you, an&#8217; you know th&#8217; ain&#8217;t no lawyer&#8217;s tricks in th&#8217;
wordin&#8217; of it. But she&#8217;s different. They was over t&#8217; our
house Sunday &#8217;fore last an&#8217; I never knowed Liza Ann t&#8217;
be&#8217;s near explodin&#8217; &#8217;s she was &#8217;fore they left. It done me
right smart good t&#8217; see &#8217;er brace up an&#8217; defend &#8217;erself. I
tell you Mis Hansen see she&#8217;d riled a hornet &#8217;fore she got
away. Liza Ann &#8217;ll take an&#8217; take, till you hit &#8217;er just
right, an&#8217; then&mdash;oh, my!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>Silas ended with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;After they left, she just told me I could exchange
works with somebody else; she wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; have that
woman comin&#8217; t&#8217; our house no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadie is awfully provoking,&#8221; Elizabeth admitted,
&#8220;but&mdash;but&mdash;Luther likes her, and Luther is a good
judge of people, I always thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Silas admitted in return, &#8220;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t understand
it. Anyhow, I never knew Liza Ann come s&#8217; near
forgettin&#8217; &#8217;erself. It was worth a day&#8217;s travel t&#8217; see.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked of other things, the baby dropped asleep in
its mother&#8217;s arms, and Silas took his departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;How unlike him,&#8221; Elizabeth said to herself as she
watched him go to his wagon.</p>
<p>Silas rode away in an ill-humour with himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now there I&#8217;ve been an&#8217; talked like a lunatic asylum,&#8221;
he meditated. &#8220;I allus was that crazy about babies!
Here I&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; talked spiteful about th&#8217; neighbours,
an&#8217; told things that hadn&#8217;t ought t&#8217; be told. If I&#8217;d a
talked about that baby, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; let &#8217;er see I was plum
foolish about it&mdash;an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t think of a blessed thing
but th&#8217; Hansens.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rode for a while with a dissatisfied air which gave
way to a look of yearning.</p>
<p>&#8220;My! How proud a man ought t&#8217; be! How little folks
knows what they&#8217;ve got t&#8217; be thankful for! Now I&#8217;ll bet
&#8217;e just takes it as a matter of course, an&#8217; never stops t&#8217;
think whether other folks is as lucky or not. She don&#8217;t.
She&#8217;s in such a heaven of delight, she don&#8217;t care if she has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
lost &#8217;er purty colour, or jumped into a life that&#8217;ll make an
ol&#8217; woman of &#8217;er &#8217;fore she&#8217;s hardly begun t&#8217; be a girl, nor
nothin&#8217;. She&#8217;s just livin&#8217; in that little un, an&#8217; don&#8217;t even
know that can&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and then he broke out again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of a man havin&#8217; all that, an&#8217; not knowin&#8217; th&#8217;
worth of it! Lord! If I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had&mdash;but there now, Liza
Ann wouldn&#8217;t want me t&#8217; mourn over it&mdash;not bein&#8217; &#8217;er
fault exactly. Guess I ought t&#8217; be patient; but I would
&#8217;a&#8217; liked a little feller.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When John came home that night Elizabeth told him
of Silas&#8217;s visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hardly looked at baby at all,&#8221; she said disappointedly,
&#8220;and I&#8217;d counted on his cunning ways with it more
than anybody&#8217;s. I thought he&#8217;d be real pleased with it,
and instead of that, he didn&#8217;t seem interested in it at all,
and sat and stared at me and talked about Sadie. I
thought sure he&#8217;d want to hold it&mdash;he&#8217;s got such cute
ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you expect an old fellow like him to care
for babies?&#8221; John said, smiling at the thought of it. &#8220;A
man has to experience such things to know what they
mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the child from her arms and sat down to rock
it while he waited for the supper to be put on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I saw Hepsie setting the sponge for
to-morrow&#8217;s bread as I came through the kitchen. I&#8217;ll
take care of baby, and you go and see about it. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
bread hasn&#8217;t been up to standard since you&#8217;ve been sick.
You&#8217;ll have to look after things a little closer now that
you are up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth, whose back was not strong, had been sitting
on the lounge, and now dropped into a reclining position
as she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;The bread has not been bad, John. Aunt Susan was
always marvelling at how good it was compared to the
usual hired girl&#8217;s bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty badly burned last time,&#8221; John observed
dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That didn&#8217;t happen in the sponge, dear, and anybody
burns the bread sometimes,&#8221; she returned; &#8220;besides that,
it makes my back ache to stir things these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter did not reply, but every line of him
showed his displeasure. It was not possible to go on talking
about anything else while he was annoyed, and the girl
began to feel she was not only lazy but easily irritated
about a very small thing. Reflecting that her back
would quit hurting if she rested afterward, she arose from
the lounge and dragged herself to the kitchen, where she
stirred the heavy sponge batter as she was bidden.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter was expected to return in a little over a
week, and the first days when Elizabeth was able to begin
to do small things about the house were spent in getting
the house cleaning done and the entire place in order for
her coming. It happened that a light frost fell upon
Kansas that year weeks before they were accustomed to
look for it; and the tomato vines were bitten. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
necessary to can quickly such as could be saved. In those
days all the fruit and vegetables used on Kansas farms
were &#8220;put up&#8221; at home, and Elizabeth, with two, and
sometimes more, hired men to cook for, was obliged to
have her pantry shelves well stocked. The heat of the
great range and the hurry of the extra work flushed the
pale face and made deep circles below her eyes, but
Elizabeth&#8217;s pride in her table kept her at her post till the
canning was done. By Saturday night the tomatoes were
all &#8220;up,&#8221; and the carpets upstairs had been beaten and
retacked. Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s room had been given the most
exact care and was immaculate with tidies and pillow-shams,
ironed by Elizabeth&#8217;s own hands, and the chickens
to be served on the occasion of her arrival were &#8220;cut up&#8221;
and ready for the frying pan.</p>
<p>Sunday there was a repast fit for a king when John and
his mother came from town. Every nerve in Elizabeth&#8217;s
body had been stretched to the limit in the production of
that meal. Too tired to eat herself, the young wife sat
with her baby in her arms and watched the hungry family
devour the faultless repast. She might be tired, but the
dinner was a success. The next morning, when the usual
rising hour of half-past four o&#8217;clock came, it seemed to
the weary girl that she could not drag herself up to superintend
the getting of the breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;ll help you with the morning work and you can
lie down afterward,&#8221; John assured her when she expressed
a half determination not to rise.</p>
<p>But after breakfast Mrs. Hunter suggested that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
scour the tinware, and the three women put in the spare
time of the entire morning polishing and rubbing pans and
lids. As they worked, Mrs. Hunter discussed tinware,
till not even the shininess of the pans upon which they
worked could cover the disappointment of the girl that her
mother-in-law should have discovered it in such a neglected
condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, child, it isn&#8217;t fit to put milk in again till it&#8217;s
in better condition. How did you happen to let it get so
dull and rusty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mother, it isn&#8217;t rusty at all. It is pretty dull,
but that&#8217;s not Hepsie&#8217;s fault. It was as bright as a pin
when I got up, but we&#8217;ve had the tomatoes to put up and
the housecleaning to do and it couldn&#8217;t be helped,&#8221;
Elizabeth replied, covering up any share the girl might
have had in the matter. She knew the extra work which
had fallen on Hepsie&#8217;s shoulders in those last weeks, and
particularly since she herself had been out of bed, for the
girl loved Elizabeth and had shielded her by extra steps
many times when her own limbs must have ached with
weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you used the tin pans for any
thing as corroding as tomatoes!&#8221; Mrs. Hunter exclaimed
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used everything in sight I think&mdash;and then didn&#8217;t
have enough,&#8221; Elizabeth said with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you should never use your milk pans for anything
but milk, dear,&#8221; the older woman remonstrated.
&#8220;You know milk takes up everything that comes its way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
and typhoid comes from milk oftener than any other
source.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no typhoids in tomatoes fresh from the
vine,&#8221; Elizabeth replied testily, and Mrs. Hunter dropped
the subject.</p>
<p>But though she dropped the subject she did not let the
pans drop till the last one shone like a mirror. With the
large number of cows they were milking many receptacles
were needed and John had got those pans because they
were lighter to handle than the heavy stone crocks used
by most farmers&#8217; wives. Elizabeth was more appreciative,
of those pans than any purchase which had been
made for her benefit in all the months she had served as
John&#8217;s housekeeper, but by the time she was through
scouring she was ready to throw them at any one who was
foolish enough to address her upon housekeeping; besides,
she plainly discerned the marks of discontent upon
Hepsie&#8217;s face. Hepsie was a faithful servitor, but she had
learned by several years of service to stop before her
energies were exhausted. It was the first sign of dissatisfaction
she had ever shown, and Elizabeth was concerned.</p>
<p>The next morning Elizabeth&#8217;s head was one solid,
throbbing globe of roar and pain. Mrs. Hunter brought
her a dainty breakfast which it was impossible for her to
eat, and said with genuine affection:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have let you do too much, my dear, and I mean to
take some of this burden off of your shoulders. You&#8217;re
not yourself yet. John tells me you were sicker than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
people usually are at such times. I ought to have helped
the girl with that tinware yesterday and sent you to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth listened with some alarm to the proposition of
Mrs. Hunter taking the house into her own hands, but she
was touched by the real sympathy and concern evident.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good of you, mother. You&#8217;ll have to be careful
about Hepsie, though. You must not call her &#8216;the girl&#8217;
where she hears you. You see she is one of our old
neighbours, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, they hate to be called that&mdash;and
they aren&#8217;t exactly servants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll get the dinner for her&mdash;it&#8217;s wash day.
Don&#8217;t try to get up,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter said, taking the breakfast
away with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful about Hepsie, mother,&#8221; Elizabeth called
after her in an undertone. &#8220;She&#8217;s a good girl, if you
understand her and&mdash;and they leave you at the drop of
a hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsie&#8217;s going came sooner than even Elizabeth had
feared. She brought a cup of coffee to her at noon, but
avoided conversation and went out at once.</p>
<p>Elizabeth called her mother-in-law to her after dinner
was over and cautioned her afresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t had a word with her that was ill-natured
or cross,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter protested indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you have, mother,&#8221; the miserable girl
replied, puzzled as to how she was to make the older
woman understand. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a way you have. I
saw that she was hurt about that tinware. She&#8217;s been
very satisfactory, really. She takes every step off of me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
that she can. She&#8217;s the best in the country&mdash;and&mdash;and
they hang together too. If we lost her, we&#8217;d have a
hard time getting another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it makes me cross to have to work with them as
if they were rotten eggs and we were afraid of breaking
one, but if I have it to do I suppose I can. I only looked
after the clothes to see that she got the streaks out of
them. I knew she was mad about something, but I
rinsed them myself; I always do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Mrs. Hunter was gone Elizabeth thought the
matter over seriously. Neither Hepsie nor any other
girl they could get in that country was going to have her
work inspected as if she were a slave. They were free-born
American women, ignorant of many things regarding
the finer kinds of housekeeping in most instances, but
independent from birth and surroundings. In fact, there
was a peculiar swagger of independence which bordered
upon insolence in most of the homes from which Kansas
help must be drawn. Elizabeth knew that their dignity
once insulted they could not be held to any contract.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter went back to the kitchen and tried to
redeem the mistakes she had made, but Hepsie would not
be cajoled and the unpleasantness grew. Saturday night
the girl came to Elizabeth and said, without looking her
in the face at all:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake says, if he can have th&#8217; team, he&#8217;ll take me home.
I&mdash;I think I won&#8217;t stay any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have to go, Hepsie?&#8221; Elizabeth said, her face
troubled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Hepsie avoided her glance because she knew the trouble
was there. Hepsie had been very happy in this house
and had been proud of a chance to keep its well supplied
shelves in satisfactory condition. Gossip hovered over
whatever went on in the Hunter home, and there was a
distinction in being associated with it; also Hepsie had
come to love Elizabeth more than she usually did her
country mistresses. She saw that all the unkind things
which were being said about Elizabeth&#8217;s stuck-up propensities
were untrue, and that Elizabeth Hunter was as
sensible and kindly as could be wished when people understood
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be up and around hereafter,&#8221; Elizabeth continued.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand mother. She&#8217;s all right,
only she isn&#8217;t used to the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I understand &#8217;er all right,&#8221; Hepsie said sullenly;
&#8220;&#8217;t wouldn&#8217;t make no difference, you bein&#8217; up.
She&#8217;d be a-tellin&#8217; me what t&#8217; do just th&#8217; same, an&#8217; I&#8217;m tired
enough, washdays, without havin&#8217; somebody t&#8217; aggravate
me about every piece that goes through th&#8217; rench.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood waiting for Elizabeth to speak, and when she
did not, added resentfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;You an&#8217; me always got along. We had a clean house,
too, if Mr. Hunter didn&#8217;t think I knew much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s surprise was complete. She had not supposed
the girl knew John&#8217;s estimate of her work. John
was usually so clever about keeping out of sight when he
insisted upon anything unpleasant that it had never
occurred to Elizabeth that Hepsie was aware that John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
insisted upon having her do things which he felt that
Hepsie could not be trusted to do unwatched. There was
nothing more to be said. She reckoned the girl&#8217;s wages,
and told her that Jake could have the team.</p>
<p>Before Hepsie went that night, she came back to the
bedroom and cuddled the baby tenderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m sorry t&#8217; go an&#8217; leave you with th&#8217; baby so
little, Lizzie. &#8217;Taint hardly fair, but&mdash;but if you worked
out a while you&#8217;d learn t&#8217; quit &#8217;fore you was wore out.&#8221;
She stood thinking a moment, and then cautioned Elizabeth
sincerely: &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; say one thing &#8217;fore I leave:
you&#8217;d better ship that old woman &#8217;fore you try t&#8217; get
another girl around these parts. I&#8217;ll be asked why I left
an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have t&#8217; tell, or git folks t&#8217; thinkin&#8217; I&#8217;m lazy
an&#8217; you won&#8217;t have me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s heart sank. She would not plead for the
girl to keep still. It would have been of no use; besides,
her own sense of fairness told her that there was room for
all that had been hinted at.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Monday John spent the day looking for a girl to take
Hepsie&#8217;s place. Tired and discouraged, he came home
about four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you get me a bite to eat?&#8221; he asked Elizabeth
as he came in. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a bite since breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laid the baby on the bed, and turned patiently
toward the kitchen. An hour was consumed in getting
the extra meal and doing the dishes afterward, and then it
was time to begin the regular supper for the rest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
family. When John found that she had thrown herself
down on the bed to nurse the baby instead of coming to the
table for her supper, he insisted that she at least come and
pour the tea, and when she sat unresistant through the
meal, but could not eat, he sent her to bed and helped his
mother wash the supper dishes without complaint. The
next morning, however, he hailed her forth to assist with
the half-past four o&#8217;clock breakfast relentlessly, unaware
that she had spent a weary and sleepless night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to look for a girl to-day?&#8221; she asked as
he was leaving the house after the breakfast was eaten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I suppose so, but I haven&#8217;t much hopes of getting
one,&#8221; he answered impatiently. Then seeing the tears in
her eyes at the thought of the washing waiting to be done,
he kissed her tenderly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the best I can, dear; I
know you&#8217;re tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the next one I get I hope mother &#8217;ll let me manage
her. If Hepsie wouldn&#8217;t stand her ways of talking
about things none of the rest will.&#8221; After a moment&#8217;s
reflection she added: &#8220;I cannot do all this work myself.
I&#8217;m so tired I&#8217;m ready to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>John slipped his arm about her and said earnestly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all I can to help you with the dinner dishes, but
you are not to say one word to mother about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was gently put, but authoritative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you needn&#8217;t look for one at all,&#8221; she said
sharply.</p>
<p>John&#8217;s arm fell from about her and he looked at her in
cold astonishment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;I can&#8217;t keep a girl and
have mother looking over every piece of washing that is
hung on the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother kept girls a long time in her own house,&#8221; he
answered, taking offence at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care; she dealt with a different kind of girls.&#8221;
Then with a sudden illumination, she added: &#8220;She didn&#8217;t
have such quantities of work to do, either. If we go on
this way we&#8217;ll have to have help and keep it or we&#8217;ll have
to cut down the farm work.&#8221; She brightened with the
thought. &#8220;Let&#8217;s cut the work down anyhow, dear. I&#8217;d
have so much an easier time and&mdash;and you wouldn&#8217;t
have all those wages to raise every month, and we could
live so much more comfortably.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see but we&#8217;re living as comfortably as folks
usually do,&#8221; John replied evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, dear, but we have to have the men at meals
all the time and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, Elizabeth, don&#8217;t go and get foolish. A
man has to make a living,&#8221; John said fretfully.</p>
<p>The girl had worked uncomplainingly until her last
remnant of strength was gone, and they were neither willing
to do the thing which made it possible to keep help,
nor to let her do the work as she was able to do it. With
it all, however, she tried patiently to explain and arrange.
Something had to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you have to make a living, John, and I often
think that I must let you do it in your own way, but there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
are so many things that are getting into a snarl while we
try it this way. We don&#8217;t have much home with strangers
at our table every day in the year. We never have a
meal alone. I wouldn&#8217;t mind that, but it makes more
work than I am able to do, it is getting you into debt
deeper every month to pay their wages, and you don&#8217;t
know how hard it is going to be to pay those debts a few
years from now. But that isn&#8217;t the worst of it as far as I
am concerned. I work all the time and you&mdash;you aren&#8217;t
satisfied with what I do when I do everything my strength
will let me do. I can&#8217;t do any more than I&#8217;m doing
either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> satisfied with what you do,&#8221; he said with evident
annoyance at having his actions and words remarked
upon. &#8220;Besides, you have mother to help you.&#8221; He
had ignored her remarks upon the question of debts,
determined to fasten the attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>The little ruse succeeded, for Elizabeth&#8217;s attention was
instantly riveted upon her own hopeless situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t much help to run the girl out and then make it
so hard to get another one,&#8221; she said bitterly.</p>
<p>Instantly she wished she had not said it. It was true,
but she wished she could have held it back. John did not
realize as she did how hard it was going to be to get
another girl. She had not told him of Hepsie&#8217;s remarks
nor of her advice. Elizabeth was not a woman to tattle, and
the &#8220;old woman&#8221; Hepsie had referred to was his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m hard on her, John. If we could only
get another girl I wouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>She waited for him to speak, and, when he did not do so,
asked hopelessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we can get another girl pretty soon if
we go a good ways off from this neighbourhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it, and I don&#8217;t want to
hear anything more about it either,&#8221; was the ungracious
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in the wrong. You will hear no more on either
subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tone was earnest. Elizabeth meant what she said.
John went from the house without the customary good-bye
kiss. We live and learn, and we learn most when we
get ourselves thoroughly in the wrong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;ENNOBLED BY THE REFLECTED STORY OF ANOTHER&#8217;S GOODNESS AND LOVE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>It was on a Saturday, three weeks after Mrs.
Hunter&#8217;s return, that Elizabeth asked to make
her first visit with the baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Susan was here so much while I was sick, John,
that I feel that we must go to see them to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my goodness!&#8221; John replied, stepping to the
cupboard to put away the pile of plates in his hands.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired enough to stay at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had just finished washing the supper dishes
together, and Elizabeth considered as she emptied the
dishpan and put it away. She had been refused so often
that she rather expected it, and yet she had thought by
the cordiality with which John had always treated Aunt
Susan that he would be reasonable about this visit now
that she was able, and the baby old enough to go out.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was never clear about a difficulty, nor had her
defences well in hand upon the first occasion. With those
she loved, and with John in particular, any offence had to
be repeated over and over again before she could protect
herself. She felt her way slowly and tried to preserve her
ideals; she tried to be fair. She could not tell quickly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
what to do about a situation; she took a long time to get
at her own attitudes and understand them, and it took her
still longer to get at the real intentions of others. As she
brought out her cold-boiled potatoes and began to peel
them for breakfast, she reflected that Aunt Susan had
come as regularly to see them as if she had always been
well treated, until Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s coming. At that point
the visits had dropped off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby is nearly three months old, and I promised Aunt
Susan that I&#8217;d take him to see her the first place I took
him. We owe it to her, and I&#8217;m not going to neglect her
any more. We can leave a dinner of cold chicken and pies
for the men, and I&#8217;ll get a hot supper for them when I
come home. I&#8217;d like to start about ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounded so much as if it were all settled that the girl
felt that it really was.</p>
<p>&#8220;That leaves mother here alone all day, and I&#8217;m not
going to do it,&#8221; John returned with equal assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother can go with us. I should want her to do that,
and I&#8217;m sure Aunt Susan would.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter was passing through the room with the
broom and dustpan and paused long enough to say
pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t count on me, children. I&#8217;ll take care of myself
and get the men a hot dinner besides. I&#8217;d just as soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d like to have you go, mother, and I&#8217;m sure Aunt
Susan would want us to bring you,&#8221; Elizabeth replied
with a little catch in her breath. If Mrs. Hunter refused
to go, John would not take her if she begged on her knees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to go. I&#8217;ll get the dinner though,
and you needn&#8217;t hurry back.&#8221; She went on upstairs
contentedly and with the feeling that she had arranged
the matter to everybody&#8217;s liking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her get the dinner then,&#8221; Elizabeth said, exasperated.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave everything ready for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not go and leave her alone all day. She has a
hard enough time out on this farm without getting the
feeling that we care as little as that for her comfort.
Besides that, the buggy is not mended yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can go in the lumber wagon. We didn&#8217;t have a
buggy till long after we were engaged,&#8221; Elizabeth said,
not going into the matter of leaving his mother at home,
which she knew would be useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d want to rest when you did get a
chance. You talk all the time about having too much to
do,&#8221; John replied evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t get any rest,&#8221; Elizabeth replied quickly.
&#8220;I&#8217;d get a dinner&mdash;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d have to do if I stayed
at home. I&#8217;d be on my feet three solid hours and then
have to nurse the baby. That&#8217;s the rest I&#8217;d have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221; was the answer she got as John went out.</p>
<p>The weeks flew past, and still Elizabeth served hot
dinners and mourned in secret over Susan Hornby&#8217;s
neglected kindness. Aunt Susan had been cheerful as
well as discreet during those weeks when she had helped
them. She had been so happy over the evident friendliness
of John Hunter that she had felt sure that the old
cordiality was to be resumed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>After what seemed to Elizabeth endless weeks, a
curious circumstance aided her in getting to Aunt Susan&#8217;s
in the end. Mrs. Hunter, who was not greatly concerned
about her disappointment, heard constant reference to
Mrs. Hornby&#8217;s assistance at the time of the baby&#8217;s coming,
and knowing that there would be discussion of their
neglect to her in the neighbourhood, joined authoritatively
in Elizabeth&#8217;s entreaty the next time it was
mentioned, thereby accomplishing through fear of gossip
a thing which no amount of coaxing on Elizabeth&#8217;s part
could ever have done, and at last the trip was to be made.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby&#8217;s home was so unchanged in the year
that Elizabeth had been gone that, but for the baby in her
arms, she could hardly have realized that she had been
away. Aunt Susan sent her to the bedroom with the
wraps when they were taken off. It was the same little
room the girl had occupied for half that year, the same
rag carpet, the same mended rocking chair which had
come to grief in the cyclone, and the knitted tidy which the
girl herself had made. With the hot tears running down
her cheeks the girl-mother threw herself upon the bed and
buried her face in the baby&#8217;s wraps to stifle the cry she
was afraid would escape her. In the sanctuary of her
girlhood&#8217;s highest hopes, Elizabeth sobbed out her disappointments
and acknowledged to herself that life had
tricked her into a sorry network of doubts and unsettled
mysteries. For the first time she sunk her pride and let
Susan think what she would of her prolonged absence,
and went openly to the kitchen to bathe her face in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
Nathan&#8217;s familiar tin basin. A sudden suspicion of
John&#8217;s reception at Nathan&#8217;s hands made it possible to
go back to Aunt Susan with a smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Indeed, Elizabeth&#8217;s suspicions were so far true that they
were a certainty. Nathan, by Luther&#8217;s marriage to a
woman the old man suspected of every evil, had cut himself
off from every friend. Nathan had been thrown in
upon himself and had pondered and nursed his suspicions
of all men, and of John Hunter in particular. He finished
the milking without offering to go into the house;
and John, who had insisted upon coming at night instead
of on a Sunday, was obliged to stand around the cow
stable and wait, or go to the house alone. He chose the
former course and was made happy by the arrival of Jake,
who had not known where his employer was going when
his team was hitched to the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been over to Luther&#8217;s, Mrs. Hornby,&#8221; Jake
said when they finally stood around Aunt Susan&#8217;s fire.
&#8220;Did you know Sadie was sick? Luther&#8217;s awful good to
&#8217;er, but I know she&#8217;d be glad t&#8217; see a woman body about
once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht she&#8217;d die an&#8217; get out of th&#8217; way,&#8221; Nathan
Hornby said bitterly. &#8220;A body could see Luther once in
a while then &#8217;thout havin&#8217; &#8217;is words cut up an&#8217; pasted
together some new way for passin&#8217; round.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one spoke, and Nathan felt called upon to defend
his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! It&#8217;s a God&#8217;s pity t&#8217; have a woman like
that carry off th&#8217; best man this country&#8217;s ever had, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
then fix up every word &#8217;is friends says t&#8217; him so&#8217;s t&#8217; make
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan&#8217;s whole bitter longing for companionship was
laid bare. Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes filled with tears; Elizabeth
was lonely also.</p>
<p>The call was a short one. John moved early to go
home and there was nothing to do but give way. It was
not till the next day that Elizabeth suspected that
Nathan&#8217;s remarks had offended John Hunter, and then in
spite of her eagerness to keep the peace between the two
men, she laughed aloud. She was also somewhat amused
at the insistence on a call upon Sadie which John wanted
that she should make. The perfect frankness of his
announcement that Luther was a convenient neighbour,
and that they must pay neighbourly attention to illness,
when he had never encouraged her to go for any other
reason, was a new viewpoint from which the young
wife could observe the workings of his mind. Something
about it subtracted from her faith in him, and in
life.</p>
<p>While she was still washing the dinner dishes John came
in to discuss the visit. Elizabeth was athrob with the
weariness of a half day spent at the ironing table, and to
avoid dressing the baby had asked Mrs. Hunter to take
care of him.</p>
<p>With no other visible reason but his customary obstinacy,
John insisted upon the child being taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get back early and get the coloured clothes
folded down. Every one of the boys had a white shirt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
and two or three collars this week, so I asked mother to
keep him for me,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here,&#8221; John argued. &#8220;Mother &#8217;ll fold those
clothes and you can just as well take him along and make
a decent visit. They&#8217;re the nicest people in the country,
according to some of the neighbours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s laugh nettled her husband. When he
appeared with the wagon, she was ready, with the baby in
her arms.</p>
<p>The wind was keen and cold, the laprobes flew and
fluttered in derisive refusal to be tucked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the buggy in and have it mended the next time
you go to town,&#8221; she said, with her teeth chattering, as
they drew near to Luther&#8217;s home. &#8220;I want to go up to
see ma before long and it&#8217;s almost impossible to keep a
baby covered on this high seat.&#8221; She thought a while and
then added, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been home since I was married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d ever want to go,&#8221; John replied
ungraciously.</p>
<p>Tears of anger as well as mortification filled her eyes,
and her throat would not work. It was to stop gossip as
much as to see her mother that the girl desired to make
the visit. The world was right: John was not proud of
her.</p>
<p>The sight of the &#8220;shanty&#8221; as they turned the corner
near Luther&#8217;s place brought a new train of thought.
Dear, kindly, sweet-souled Luther! The world disapproved
of his marriage too. He was coming toward them
now, his ragged overcoat blowing about him as he jumped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
over the ridges made by the plow in turning out the late
potatoes he had been digging.</p>
<p>&#8220;You carry the baby in for Lizzie, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tie these
horses,&#8221; he said, beaming with cordiality. &#8220;Got caught
with Sadie&#8217;s sickness an&#8217; let half th&#8217; potatoes freeze &#8217;s
hard &#8217;s brickbats.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so cold that Elizabeth did not stand to ask about
Sadie, but turned to the house to escape the blast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come for you at five if I can get back. I&#8217;m going
over to see about some calves at Warren&#8217;s,&#8221; John said as
they went up the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that why you insisted that I bring the baby? You
needn&#8217;t have been afraid to tell me; you do as you please
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H-s-sh! Here comes Hansen,&#8221; John Hunter said
warningly, and turned back to the wagon, giving the child
into Luther&#8217;s arms at the door.</p>
<p>Luther Hansen cuddled the child warmly to him and
without waiting to go in the house raised the white shawl
from its sleeping face for a peep at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost ours,&#8221; he said simply.</p>
<p>The house sheltered them from the wind, and Elizabeth
stopped and looked up at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it? I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know you were
expecting a child, Luther. I&#8217;m so sorry. I wish I&#8217;d
known.&#8221;</p>
<p>The expression of sympathy escaped her unconsciously.
Elizabeth would always want to know of Luther&#8217;s joys
and sorrows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>A glad little light softened the pain in his face, and he
looked at her with a steady gaze, discerning the feeling of
sound friendship behind the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are,&#8221; he said, expressing the confirmation
of a thing he had never doubted. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t askin&#8217; you
any questions, Lizzie, I just know&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>With something like a glow about his heart, he opened
the door of his simple dwelling. He had never doubted
her, nor believed the nonsense he had heard about her,
but he had just had his faith refreshed. He carried the
baby to the one little bedroom of his house, scuffing a
wooden rocking chair behind him across the rough floor.
He established Elizabeth in it beside Sadie, and then placing
the sleeping child in its mother&#8217;s arms went back to
the potato field, hurrying his work to finish before dark.
He understood in a measure why this was Elizabeth&#8217;s first
visit to them, and he did not resent it. Luther never
resented. He lived his own kindly, industrious life. If
people did not like Sadie he accepted it as a fact, but not as
a thing to be aggrieved about. He could wait for Sadie
to grow, and others must wait also. In the meantime,
Luther watched Elizabeth and desired growth for her; her
smallest movement was of interest to him. Elizabeth as a
mother was a new feature. He remembered the deft way
she had nestled the baby to her as he had relinquished it
a few moments before, and thought with a sigh, of the cowhide-covered
trunk filled with little garments under the
bed by which she sat. Not even Sadie knew what the loss
of that first child meant to Luther. A new love for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
women&#8217;s ways with babies grew up in him as he thought
of Elizabeth&#8217;s cuddling.</p>
<p>In the house, Elizabeth was getting into touch with the
young mother who was childless. Sadie, in spite of a
determination not to do so, was warming to that touch
reluctantly. After all, it was pleasant to be telling Elizabeth
about it, and to have her asking as if she wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I took bad about a week ago,&#8221; she was saying.
&#8220;I&#8217;d been kind of miserable for several days. I got a fall
that last rain we had, an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t seem t&#8217; get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have come sooner if I&#8217;d known it,&#8221; Elizabeth said,
thinking of Luther&#8217;s acceptance of a similar statement.
&#8220;Jake didn&#8217;t even tell us last night what was the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he didn&#8217;t know. Would you &#8217;a&#8217; come if you&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; known, Lizzie?&#8221; Before Elizabeth could reply, she continued,
&#8220;Ma used t&#8217; think it&#8217;d be kind o&#8217; nice for me t&#8217; live
close t&#8217; you, but I knew you wouldn&#8217;t never come t&#8217; see
me. I used t&#8217; be kind o&#8217; jealous cause Luther liked you s&#8217;
much. I said everything mean I could think of about
you, t&#8217; him&mdash;but law! Luther ain&#8217;t got no pride. He
don&#8217;t care. He defends you from everybody, whether
you come t&#8217; see us &#8217;r not.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a curious little confession and one Sadie had not
intended to make. Something big and sweet in Elizabeth
had forced it from her. It embarrassed Elizabeth Hunter,
and it held things which could not be discussed, and she
turned the subject without answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you lose the baby?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it only lived a couple of hours. You see it was too
soon an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; it wasn&#8217;t right. Th&#8217; doctor didn&#8217;t expect
it t&#8217; live as long as it did, but Luther would have it that
it could, an&#8217; kept &#8217;em a tryin&#8217; everything that could be
thought of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie&#8217;s voice died away gradually and she lay looking
out of the window retrospectively: the last two weeks had
brought food for much thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, Lizzie, that a man could be as good as
Luther. I&#8217;d always kind o&#8217; hated men, an&#8217; I thought I&#8217;d
have t&#8217; fight my way through, like th&#8217; rest of th&#8217; women,
an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;he&#8217;s that good an&#8217; thoughtful of me, an&#8217; of
everybody else, that I&#8217;m clean ashamed of myself half th&#8217;
time. He nearly had a fit when&#8217; he found out that I&#8217;d
slipped with that wood. &#8217;Twas ironing day, an&#8217; th&#8217; box
got empty&mdash;an&#8217; then, when th&#8217; baby died, it just seemed
as if he couldn&#8217;t stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at Elizabeth earnestly: &#8220;I never heard
any one but th&#8217; preacher pray out loud, Lizzie, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;somehow&mdash;well,&#8221;
she stumbled, &#8220;Luther prayed so
sweet, when he see it was gone&mdash;I&mdash;I ain&#8217;t thought of
much else since. It&mdash;it seemed like th&#8217; baby&#8217;d done
something good t&#8217; both of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spiteful, pettish face was for the moment ennobled
by the reflected glory of another&#8217;s goodness and love.
Elizabeth caught a glimpse of a condition which makes
heaven here upon earth. There was the harmony here
in the &#8220;shanty&#8221; such as she coveted and strove in vain to
establish in her own home. Of course there would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
harmony where Luther Hansen was concerned: Luther
<i>was</i> harmony. Ignoring his part in the little drama, she
was wise enough to touch the other side of the story in
her reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;These little ones bring blessings all their own, Sadie,&#8221;
she said, giving the hand on the patchwork quilt a little
squeeze.</p>
<p>There was that in the impulsive little touch which was
to be a lasting reminder to Sadie Hansen that Elizabeth
Hunter responded to the things which were making of her
life a different story. They had found common ground,
where neither scoffed at the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did your baby make you feel that way?&#8221; she asked
earnestly.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Luther came at five o&#8217;clock to say that John was
waiting he found them, at peace, with the baby between
them.</p>
<p>Luther tucked Elizabeth and her child into the unprotected
wagon seat with concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wind&#8217;s a tartar. Pull th&#8217; covers down tight over
its face, Lizzie. What&#8217;s become of th&#8217; buggy, Hunter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther saw Elizabeth&#8217;s face harden in a sudden contraction
of pain, and glanced across at John, but whatever
there was about it that hurt belonged to Elizabeth alone,
for John Hunter pulled at the flapping laprobes without
seeming to have heard clearly and evidently thinking that
the remark was addressed to his wife. Dusk was falling,
and Luther watched them drive away with a premonition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
of trouble as the night seemed to close in about them. He
turned his back to the wind and stood humped over, peering
through the evening at their disappearing forms. He
saw Elizabeth snatch at the corner of the robe as they
turned into the main road, and dug his own hands deeper
into his pockets with his attention turned from Elizabeth
and her possible trouble to that of the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope th&#8217; little feller don&#8217;t ketch cold.&#8221; He turned to
the house filled with his vision of a baby being cuddled
close in a mother&#8217;s arms, and with a new understanding of
the comfort of such cuddling. His breath flew before him
in a frosty stream when he entered the kitchen, and he
hastened to build a fire and set the teakettle on to heat.
He lighted a lamp and set it on a chair, and also stirred the
fire in the little stove in Sadie&#8217;s room before he went to
milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht Lizzie&#8217;d come oftener. Wonder why she don&#8217;t.
She don&#8217;t seem near as stuck-up as she used to. Say,
Luther, Lizzie told me th&#8217; queerest thing: she says th&#8217; way
a mother feels before a baby&#8217;s born makes a difference.
She says if a woman&#8217;s mean before a child comes It&#8217;ll
make th&#8217; young one mean too. She told a lot of things
that showed it&#8217;s true, about folks we know? I wonder
how she learns everything? Ain&#8217;t she smart! I wisht
she&#8217;d come oftener. Say, if I ever get that way again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
The sentence was unfinished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht ours &#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; lived,&#8221; Luther said longingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Lizzie&#8217;s baby make you feel that way too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther went to milk with a song in his heart. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
little word &#8220;too&#8221; told more than all the discussions they
had ever had. Sadie had not been pleased about the
coming of the child they had lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could get &#8217;em together more,&#8221; he said wistfully.
&#8220;It was a good thing t&#8217; have &#8217;er see Lizzie an&#8217; &#8217;er baby
together. I hope th&#8217; little Tad don&#8217;t ketch cold. That
laprobe didn&#8217;t stay tucked in very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he rose from milking the last cow, his mind went
back to his visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217; hurt Lizzie about th&#8217; buggy &#8217;r somethin&#8217;&mdash;she&#8217;s
too peaked for her, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther&#8217;s premonitions about the Hunter baby were
only too well founded. The cold was not serious, but
there was a frightened skirmish for hot water and lubricants
before morning. The hoarse little cough gave way
under the treatment, but the first baby&#8217;s first cold is
always a thing of grave importance to inexperienced
parents, and Elizabeth knew that her chances of getting
to go home, or any other place, that winter, were lessened.
Her growing fear of neighbourhood criticism outgrew her
fear of refusal, however, and at the end of the next week
she reminded her husband that she had planned to take
the child to see her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be willing to take that child out again; I&#8217;m
not,&#8221; he replied severely.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A bright idea struck Elizabeth&#8217;s imagination after she
had gone to bed that night. Why not ask her own family,
the Chamberlains, Aunt Susan&#8217;s, and Luther Hansen&#8217;s to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
Thanksgiving dinner? She was so elated by the idea that
she could hardly get to sleep at all, and before she could settle
herself to rest she had killed in her imagination the half
dozen or more turkeys she had raised that season. A big
dinner given to those who could act as mouthpieces would
silence a lot of talk; also, it would take away a certain
questioning look the girl feared in Luther&#8217;s and Aunt
Susan&#8217;s eyes. The latter was the sorest point of her
married life, and the conviction that they were thinking
much worse things than were true did not make her any
more comfortable. All Sunday she planned, and Sunday
night went to bed with the first secret thought she had
ever harboured from her husband&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter entered into the plan with zest when on
Monday afternoon it became necessary to tell her. She
had begun to love her son&#8217;s wife in spite of her family
history. Had Elizabeth known how to manage it she
could have made of John&#8217;s mother a comfortable ally, but
Elizabeth, with characteristic straightforwardness, sought
no alliance except the natural one with her husband.
The two women planned the articles to be served in the
dinner, and then turned to the discussion of other preparations
about the house. Elizabeth was proud of the home
of which she was a part, but her strength was limited
since baby&#8217;s coming, and after looking about her critically
decided that there would be no necessity for any more
cleaning than the regular weekly amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get the cleaning done on Wednesday
instead of Friday, but I think that will be all that will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
needed. The carpets were put down fresh the week before
you came home, and I don&#8217;t intend to take them up again
till spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter agreed, &#8220;but You&#8217;ll have to
have the curtains in the dining room washed, and the
tidies and pillow-shams done up fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mother!&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed, &#8220;don&#8217;t begin to
lay out work I can&#8217;t get done. The tidies are not hard,
and I could do the shams, but those curtains are not to be
thought of. I&#8217;d be so tired if I had to go to work and
wash all that, after the washing I put on the line to-day,
that I just wouldn&#8217;t be able to get the dinner on the table
Thursday. Talking about the dinner, I think we&#8217;d better
have two turkeys. I can roast two by putting them in the
one big pan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter was willing that the younger woman
should prove her talent as a cook, but she planned to take
some of the necessary things upon her own shoulders, and
to take her son into her schemes for brightening things up
a bit. Accordingly, the next morning she asked John to
help her take the curtains down.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had been so full of her own plans that she had
forgotten to tell John&#8217;s mother that she intended to keep
them secret till she had all her preparations made.
The next morning when she heard the thud of some
one stepping down from a chair, and her husband say:
&#8220;There you are! How do you happen to be taking the
curtains down at this time of the week?&#8221; she realized
as she had never done before how much afraid of him she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
really was, for her pulses bounded, and her ears boomed
like cannon, long before John had time to appear in the door
to inquire who was coming, and why they were to do so.</p>
<p>With a look very much like guilt, Elizabeth told over the
names of her proposed guests, but with Mrs. Hunter in the
next room she could not tell him why it meant so much to
her to ask these people to dine with them.</p>
<p>The customary protest was offered without delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d do it, dear. Thanksgiving is a day
for home folks, not neighbours, and, besides, see all the
work it will make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The work is just what we choose to make it. If I&#8217;d
known mother was going to clean house I wouldn&#8217;t have
said anything about it,&#8221; Elizabeth answered sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; John Hunter said in a low tone and with a look
of anger that was direct and full of meaning.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was ready to cry. She was angry. In every
move she made she was checkmated; not because it was
not a good move, but because it was hers. She could
readily have given up any one thing as it came along, but
the true meaning and spirit of these interferences were
beginning to dawn upon her. However, once more she
yielded to the unreasonable wishes of her husband and the
dinner was given up. She made no attempt to finish the
mincemeat they had planned to chop after dinner, but
after putting the baby to sleep threw a shawl about her
and slipping out of the house ran to the barn and down the
creek in the pasture while John was helping his mother
rehang the freshly ironed curtains.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>They were only having two meals a day now that the
corn was all picked, and dinner came so late in the afternoon
that there was already a blaze of sunset colour in the
west as she passed around the barn and started down the
bank of the stream. The sun had set, but was still reflected
on the heaps of billowy gray clouds just above the
horizon. It made the snow in front of her a delicate pink.
The girl had not got far enough from the house to see a
sunset for months. The freshness and keenness of the
air, the colours in the sky, the grandeur and sublimity of
it all chased away her anger and left her in a mood to
reason over her situation. She followed the cow-path
down to the bed of the stream and then threaded her way
along its winding route for a greater distance than she had
ever gone before. A broken willow barred her way after
a time, and she climbed up on its swaying trunk and let
her feet dangle over the frozen streamlet below. The
snow made lighter than usual the early evening and
extended the time she could safely stay so far from the
house.</p>
<p>The colours faded rapidly from the sky and the bewildered
girl returned to her own affairs, which were puzzling
enough. Of late she had found herself unable to maintain
her enthusiasm. She found herself increasingly irritable&mdash;from
her standpoint the one thing most to be despised
in others and which she had supposed most impossible in
herself. There were so many unforeseen possibilities
within herself that she devoted her entire attention to her
own actions and impulses, and was completely drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
away from the consideration of the motives of others by
her struggle with the elemental forces in which she found
herself engulfed. The temper aroused by John&#8217;s objection
to her Thanksgiving company had indications in
spite of the fact that she had controlled it. Elizabeth
knew that she had but barely kept her speech within the
limits of kindliness and consideration for Mrs. Hunter,
who had not wished to frustrate her plans at all, and she
knew that she would be less likely to do so if the offence
were repeated. She knew that Mrs. Hunter tried with
real honesty of purpose to keep on good terms with her,
and yet she also knew that she was increasingly annoyed
with whatever she did. There was an element of unfairness
in her attitude toward the older woman which
alarmed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just like pa, after all,&#8221; she thought as she swung
her feet and looked in a troubled way down at the frozen
stream below.</p>
<p>Elizabeth reflected that when Aunt Susan, or Silas, or
Luther Hansen came into the house she became instantly
her own buoyant, optimistic self: not that she intentionally
feigned such feelings for the benefit of her company,
but she felt the presence of trust, of faith in herself and her
powers. She did not recognize that such trust was necessary
to the unfoldment of character, nor even that it was
her birthright.</p>
<p>The girl watched the gathering twilight and deliberately
let the time pass without attempting to return to the
house until compelled to do so by real darkness, realizing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
that some beneficial thing was happening in her in this
free out-of-doors place, for she was less annoyed and more
analytical with each breath she drew in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only I&#8217;d take time to do this sort of thing I&#8217;d be
more as I ought to be,&#8221; she meditated when she had at
last risen to go home. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be like pa! I won&#8217;t! I
won&#8217;t!&#8221; she reiterated many times as she walked back,
over the frozen cow-path. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come here every few days.
Ma and pa were born to be happy, only they never took
time to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And though John was cross because the baby had cried
in her absence, Elizabeth felt that she had been helped by
getting away from him. She accepted her husband&#8217;s
reproaches without reply, and was able to forget them
even while they were still issuing from his mouth. She
kept her temper down all that week, and though the
Thanksgiving invitations were not sent, she cooked the
dinner and put as many hours into its concoction as if she
had had all the people she had hoped to have about her
board to eat it, and she was so sunny and natural as she
served it that John did not even guess that she was governing
herself consciously. She stayed at home the next
Sunday and the next, and John Hunter was unaware that
she was endeavouring to surrender herself to his will.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get over wanting to run somewhere all the
time,&#8221; he told his mother, and Mrs. Hunter, to whom
these people were not pleasing, agreed with him, and
thought that it was just as well if it were so, not realizing
that the girl lived alone in their house and that she might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
have an attitude toward these people distinctly different
from theirs.</p>
<p>This winter, like the preceding one, passed with Elizabeth
at home. There was no peace to be had if she thought
of going anywhere for any purpose whatever. Elizabeth
went nowhere and required few clothes. The cold the
child had caught on that first trip to Luther&#8217;s was sufficient
excuse to prevent any further foolishness on the part
of its mother. However, a trip to town was in waiting for
Elizabeth Hunter and was proposed by John Hunter himself.</p>
<p>There had been a &#8220;warm spell&#8221; in the month of February
and John had asked Elizabeth to help him with the
pump in the barnyard, which had been working badly for
days. It was Saturday evening, and Jake and the other
hired man had been granted time off that day; the pump
had refused to work at all after they were gone, and with a
hundred cattle waiting for water it was necessary to
impress any one available with the duty of helping.
Elizabeth was more than willing to help: it meant a couple
of hours out of doors. They had worked industriously
and their efforts were about crowned with success when
Mrs. Hunter came out to them with the baby wrapped in
a warm shawl. John tossed aside the extra piece of
leather he had cut from the top of an old boot and fitted
the round piece in his hand about the sucker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mother, you shouldn&#8217;t bring that child out here;
You&#8217;ll have him sick on our hands again,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, lots of children go out of doors in winter. I took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
you out whenever I wanted to, and you&#8217;ve lived to tell the
tale,&#8221; his mother said easily, seating herself on the end of
the trough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want anything to happen to him for a
few days, I can tell you. I want you to keep him and let
Elizabeth go in to town with me and sign the mortgage on
this eighty, Monday,&#8221; John replied, examining the valve
with great attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought this eighty was already mortgaged!&#8221;
Mrs. Hunter exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is,&#8221; John replied uneasily, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got to
raise the interest before I can get that bunch of shoats
ready to sell, and I&#8217;ve got to do it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not look at either of the two women, but kept
himself very busy about the rod and sucker he was manipulating.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter seldom remarked upon anything that was
done about the farm, but this was surprising news. <i>A
second mortgage</i> on part of the land! She had just opened
her mouth to speak, when she happened to glance across
at her daughter-in-law. Elizabeth&#8217;s face was white.
Something in it implored Mrs. Hunter to go away, to
leave them to have the matter out together, and the older
woman took her cue from it and went with a haste which
caused her son to look up from the piston with which he
fumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone to the house; I motioned to her to go,&#8221;
Elizabeth announced. &#8220;She don&#8217;t know much about
mortgages, but she knows this won&#8217;t do. You told me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
last week that the hogs would be ready in time. My soul
alive, John! do you realize what you are doing? This is
the home-eighty! What&#8217;s happened to the hogs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look here! If I want to mortgage this eighty,
I&#8217;m going to do it. Those hogs are just where it pays to
feed them. If I sell now, I&#8217;ll lose half the profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>John got up and faced her ready to fight, if fight he must
on this question. He had chosen an opportune time to
tell it, but he meant to do as he wished about those hogs
and the land and whatever else they possessed. He hated
to open a discussion, but he did not hate to continue one
after he had made the plunge. He had feasible reasons
for all that he did.</p>
<p>Elizabeth saw that he meant to insist and she resented
the deception he had practised in securing this loan without
telling her, but the danger was so great that she could
not afford to let her feelings blind her, nor to put the thing
in a bad light by seeming to wrangle about it. She looked
at him steadily, so steadily, in fact, that John was disconcerted.
The work in hand gave excuse for withdrawing
his eyes and Elizabeth watched him arrange the knot
of the rope so that they could lower the pipe back into
the well. The girl did not begin to speak at once: she
marshalled her forces and considered what manner of
argument she would put forth. She knew that every
piece of land they possessed except the Mitchell County
pastures was covered with one third of its value in incumbrances.
If the interest was hard to meet now, what
would it be three years hence? She had come to understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
that the man she had married was not a farmer.
She helped him lower the long pipe into the well, and
watched him try the pump handle to see if the sucker
would work. It was slow in drawing, and she filled a
small pail from the trough and poured it into the pump
head. After a few sputtering strokes the water began to
come freely, and then she had to wait for the pumping to
stop before she could make herself heard above its rumblings.</p>
<p>John Hunter knew perfectly well that Elizabeth was
waiting and prolonged the work till the great trough was
full. When it began to overflow and there was no further
need for drawing water, he turned abruptly toward the
gate where the cattle were. Elizabeth had waited in the
frosty air till she was chilled from standing and could not
remain for the stock to drink before she had a chance to go
to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you before those cattle come out
here,&#8221; she said, more hurt by his avoidance of her now
than she had been by the original deception; he was really
ignoring her as a factor in their mutual affairs. &#8220;I have to
protest against this mortgage, John. We ought to keep a
small home free at least, and instead of putting more on
this eighty we ought to sell enough of the stuff to pay off
on this part. Every farmer in this country has his nose
on the interest grindstone, and my life has been spoiled
with it ever since I can remember. Please, dear, let&#8217;s not
put a second mortgage on this eighty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her anxiety to get John&#8217;s attention Elizabeth went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
forward and put her hand on his arm, forgetting in her
earnestness the slight he had just shown toward her in
ignoring her claims to a voice in the matter.</p>
<p>John Hunter shook off the detaining hand impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to run this business you may as well do
it without my help and I&#8217;ll quit,&#8221; he said, his body braced
away from her with the plain intimation that he preferred
that she should not touch him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated. Her impulse was to turn and
leave him without further words, but the farm, their future
comfort, the whole scheme of family peace and harmony
depended upon obtaining a hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to run things&mdash;really, I do not. I&#8217;ve
never tried to, but I&#8217;ve lived on a farm, and I know how
impossible it is ever to raise a mortgage if you get it on a
place. I&mdash;let&#8217;s sell enough to raise the one we have on
this eighty while we can, instead. I&#8217;m willing to live on a
little; but, oh, John, I do so want to have one place that is
our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s money in those cattle,&#8221; John answered sullenly.
&#8220;A woman don&#8217;t know anything about such
things. You&#8217;ll go and get mother started on it too, I
suppose. I&#8217;m going to do as I see fit about it, anyhow.
I know there&#8217;s money to be made there.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a great sob in her throat, Elizabeth turned to the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Elizabeth,&#8221; John called after her peremptorily.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stopped respectfully to listen, but she did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
return to his side. John waited, thinking she would come
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cattle ain&#8217;t like ordinary farming,&#8221; he argued with a
flush of anger. &#8220;A man simply has to take time to let
steers grow into money. We haven&#8217;t been at it a long
enough time. Those big steers will be ready to feed this
fall, and corn&#8217;s going to be cheap. We&#8217;d be cutting off
our noses to spite our own faces to sell now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; the girl replied bitterly, and went on to the
house.</p>
<p>She knew that John had argued with the hope of getting
her to admit herself in the wrong, not to hear her side of
the case.</p>
<p>John Hunter gazed after his retreating wife in vexed
petulance for a moment and then, with a sigh of relief,
turned toward the waiting cattle.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be ready when I want to go to town all the
same,&#8221; he reflected.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>MORTGAGES OF SOUL</h3>
</div>

<p>The mortgage was signed. The fine weather had
brought many people to Colebyville. Elizabeth
had not been in town for a year, and the sight of
pleasant, happy folk greeting each other cordially and
wandering from store to store bartering eggs and butter
for groceries and family necessities, and exchanging ideas
and small talk about their purchases, had accentuated her
isolation. Those people who knew her spoke to her also,
but with an air of suspicion and reserve. A puzzling
feature of the day had been that John had received a more
cordial reception than she had. The main suspicion had
been directed against her. There seemed to be a certain
acceptance of John&#8217;s &#8220;stuck-upness.&#8221; He had some reason
for his attitude toward them which they were inclined
to accept, but Elizabeth saw that to this community
she was a &#8220;beggar on horseback.&#8221; Instead of seeing that
the man who had thrust her into this false relation was
utterly inadequate to realize it, or that if he realized it he
was utterly indifferent to her sufferings in it, she inquired
into her own failure to get his attention, and felt that he
was after all a better husband than any she had ever
known, with few exceptions. John had managed to add
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
to her confusion where he was concerned that day by being
floridly insistent upon her spending a generous sum upon
her purchases and taking as much interest in what she
bought as a woman. There had been so much to buy that
Elizabeth&#8217;s economical soul had been torn by the desire
to cut down the expense. The baby was ready for short
clothes and there had been materials for little dresses,
stockings, little shoes, a hood and cloak, to get for him
alone, and Elizabeth saw in every dollar spent a dollar lost
at interest-paying time. John had been happy and genial
on the way home and had altogether treated her so much
better than her mood had permitted her to treat him that
there was a bit of self-accusation in her meditations.
Everything had gone wrong. The waters of human
affection ran everywhere in the wrong direction. She
desired understanding between herself and her husband;
her attitude toward the community in which they lived
had been one of friendliness, her attitude toward Aunt
Susan and Luther one of whole-hearted love, her attitude
toward this family of which she found herself a part that
of a devoted slave, yet nowhere had she been able to make
proper alliances. Some curious defeating element had
crept into every relation life offered her. While the rest
ate supper that night, Elizabeth, who had no appetite
and was too sick with a sense of failure to eat, nursed her
baby and meditated upon the indications of the day&#8217;s
occurrences. Forgetting her surroundings, she drew in a
fluttering, sobbing breath. Jake Ransom, across the corner
of the table, caught the sound of that sob and flashed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
quick glance in her direction. His eyes were as quickly
withdrawn, but Elizabeth knew without looking up that
he had heard. With a desire to escape observation, she
made an excuse of putting the baby away and went to the
bedroom with the child. Slipping him into his little nightdress
she made him comfortable for the night, after which
she went back to the dining room to keep Jake from thinking
she had anything to cry about. There was an added
hum of voices, and she went in with some curiosity.</p>
<p>Silas Chamberlain stood beside the stove with his old
cap and his home-knit mittens under his arm, while he
leaned over the welcome fire. The blues were gone
instantly. There was such a glad light in her eyes as she
advanced to meet him that Jake Ransom wondered if he
had been mistaken in the quivering breath, and there was
such genuine pleasure in her surprised greeting that Silas
Chamberlain was warmed and fed by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that baby?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t
gone an&#8217; tucked him into bed this time o&#8217; night, have you?
I come special t&#8217; see &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>
<p>For months Elizabeth had wanted to see Silas and the
baby in a &#8220;free for all tumble&#8221; and her eyes danced with
delight at the idea. She had not had such a thrill in
many weeks; the young mother spoke in every line of her
young face. As if by magic her troubles fell away from
her. Crooking her finger beckoningly at the old man,
she crept on tiptoe to the bedroom door. She had left a
lamp lighted in the room and it was possible to observe
the baby without him being aware of their presence. Silas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
had crept behind her like an Indian stalking a deer, and
she caught his suppressed breath as she turned with her
finger on her lips at the door. The rest of the group trailed
behind with anticipatory grins.</p>
<p>Master John Hunter lay on the bed, very wide awake,
making sputtering efforts to devour his thumb, while he
kicked his little feet as vigorously as the confines of the
pinning-blanket would allow.</p>
<p>Silas chuckled. Hearing a noise at the door, the heir
of the house rolled his head on his pillow till his mother&#8217;s
face came within the range of his vision. Her absence
that day had made the child more than usually eager for
her presence. The little feet kicked more wildly than
ever, and forgetting the generous slice of thumb still to be
devoured, he grinned such a vast and expansive grin that
the hand to which the thumb was attached, being free,
joined the other in waving salutations of such joyful
pantomime that the object of his industrious beckonings,
completely carried into the current, rushed at him and,
sweeping him up in her arms, tossed him on high as gleefully
as if she had not been weighed down by care but a
moment before the old man&#8217;s advent into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, Mr. Chamberlain, was there ever another like
him?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Baby, who had come down from a point as high as his
mother&#8217;s arms could reach, doubled his fat little body
together with a smothered, squeezed off little gurgle of
delight. Silas was aquiver with sympathetic glee. Those
were not the days when babies were raised by scientific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
rules, and Silas caught the child from its mother&#8217;s arms
and repeated the tossing process, while the baby shouted
and struggled. At last the three, followed by the family,
retired to convenient chairs about the sitting-room fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jack Horner, you can pare that thumb down a
leetle more if you want t&#8217;. You&#8217;ve swallowed enough wind
to give you the colic for a day or two,&#8221; Silas said when the
child began to hiccough.</p>
<p>Elizabeth clapped her hands delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have named the baby!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; Silas asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, John can&#8217;t bear to have him called Johnnie, and
John is too awfully old for him now. Little Jack Horner&mdash;no,
Little Jack Hunter. I&#8217;m so glad! I just do love it;
and we had called him Baby till I was afraid we&#8217;d never
quit it,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>They kept the old man as long as they could induce him
to stay, and when he did go home it was with the settled
conviction that he had been wanted. He described the
visit enthusiastically to Liza Ann and tried to induce her
to go over to see Elizabeth the next Sunday. Silas craved
the privilege of that baby&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Si,&#8221; his wife replied, &#8220;but she could come here
if she wanted to. It&#8217;s her fool notions. John was th&#8217;
greatest hand t&#8217; go you ever saw till he married her, an&#8217;
now he don&#8217;t go nowhere, an&#8217; when I asked him about it,
he said she wasn&#8217;t well! She&#8217;s as well as any woman
that&#8217;s nursin&#8217;, an&#8217; she&#8217;s got his mother t&#8217; help &#8217;er too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t pretend t&#8217; know th&#8217; why&#8217;s an&#8217; th&#8217; wherefores
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
of it, but I do know there ain&#8217;t a stuck-up bone in
&#8217;er body&mdash;I don&#8217;t care what nobody says,&#8221; loyal Silas
Chamberlain replied.</p>
<p>The new mood stayed with Elizabeth Hunter and called
for much perplexed introspection. It had been a perplexing
day. There was no reason that she could assign
for her contradictory actions. She found herself even
softened toward John and able to enter into his attempt
to be sociable after Silas&#8217;s departure. He seemed to be
anxious to set himself before her in a kindlier light and she
was able to meet the attempt as he wished. Elizabeth
lost faith in herself as she saw her apparent whimsicalness
and began to lash herself into line as John and his mother
wished. She asked no more to be taken places.</p>
<p>In May, Luther came to help John with his team, and
for the first time in months Elizabeth saw a neighbour
woman. Luther lifted Sadie down from the high seat
with as much care as if she had been a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadie&#8217;s lonesome at the house alone all day, an&#8217; it was
good of you, Lizzie, t&#8217; ask &#8217;er,&#8221; he said as he climbed back
into the wagon.</p>
<p>Elizabeth wanted a visit with Luther, himself, but was
less fearful of a day with Sadie than she had been. She
took her guest into the house and at the sitting-room door
paused to point to Master Jack, who sat on an old quilt
with a pillow at his back, digging his little heels into the
floor and holding out dimpled hands imploringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling child!&#8221; Sadie cried, going down on her
knees at his side and hugging him till he sent up an indignant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
howl. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he cunnin&#8217;? Isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; she cried,
releasing him and subsiding into a doubled figure by his
side. &#8220;Honestly, Lizzie, why don&#8217;t you bring him over?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked so insistent, that she had to be answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go any place, Sadie,&#8221; Elizabeth answered
truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it so, that Mr. Hunter won&#8217;t take you?&#8221; Sadie
asked, and then at sight of the anger in Elizabeth&#8217;s face
rose to her knees and laid her hand on her arm hastily.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that to hurt; honestly, Lizzie, I didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m
trying not to do that this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s indignation was cooled slightly by the genuineness
of the speech, but she did not understand the last
sentence till her eye happened to fall on Sadie&#8217;s form. In
a flash she saw what was meant. Forgetting her hurt,
she was silent from pure delight. She knew what a child
would mean in that home. The other misunderstood her
silence and hastened on with her apologies:</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest, Lizzie, I didn&#8217;t want to hurt, but they do say
such mean things about it that I want you t&#8217; know. Why
don&#8217;t you ever take Mrs. Hunter and th&#8217; baby and go t&#8217;
meetin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s face went white as she realized that she
must continue to answer since she had begun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care in the least what they say, Sadie, and I
don&#8217;t want you ever to mention this to me again,&#8221; she said
sternly.</p>
<p>Sadie&#8217;s face worked in silent misery till she could control
her voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be mad at me, Lizzie? I told Luther I
wouldn&#8217;t be mean t&#8217; nobody till <i>it</i> was born,&#8221; she said with
quivering lip.</p>
<p>Elizabeth took some seconds to consider the thing that
had been told to her. It was of far more importance than
the gossip Sadie had just hinted at, but the gossip must be
answered first.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be mad at you at all,&#8221; she said after a moment.
&#8220;That is, I won&#8217;t if I never have to listen to such things
again. I don&#8217;t care in the least, if I don&#8217;t have to hear it.
Don&#8217;t ever come to me again with anything that anybody
says. Now, then, tell me about yourself. I half believe
you&#8217;re glad of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad?&#8221; Sadie told her secret, which could be a secret
no more. Luther had wanted the child, and she had come
to the point of wanting it for his sake, and the sight of
chubby Jack Hunter had aroused the latent mother love
in her till, as she talked, her eyes shone with the brightness
of imaginative maternity. She implored Elizabeth to
come to her aid when the day of her labour arrived in
September, and rambled along telling of their preparations
for its coming, and little home incidents, disclosing a
home life of so sweet a character that if Elizabeth Hunter
had not been sincere and utterly without jealousy she
would have drawn the discussion to a close.</p>
<p>The incident had a peculiar effect upon Elizabeth. She
began really to like Sadie, and all her old desire for harmony
in the home welled up in her anew. The old attitude
of self-blame was assumed also. Here was Sadie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
Crane, the most spiteful girl that had ever been raised on
these prairies, able to command the love and respect of
the man she had married, to do things because her husband
desired them, even so difficult a thing as the bearing
of children, and she, Elizabeth, had failed to accomplish
any of these things. There was a renewed resolve to be
more patient. Elizabeth hated sulking, and the remembrance
of the day when she had gone to sign the
mortgage and had been unable to respond to John&#8217;s good-humoured
willingness to get abundant supplies because
she saw the money going out so fast was fixed in her mind
with new significance. Here was Sadie doing the things
that her husband wished of her and obtaining not only his
love but her own self-respect, while she, Elizabeth, was
able to command neither. Instead of reasoning upon
the differences between the two husbands, Elizabeth reasoned
on the differences between her own actions and those
of Sadie, and from the results of that reasoning entered
upon a period of self-denial and abject devotion to the
man of her choice. John Hunter accepted this new devotion
with satisfied serenity, and, not being obstructed
in any of his little exactions, became more cheerful and
agreeable to live with. This added to Elizabeth&#8217;s
conviction that the difficulty had been somewhat
within herself. She ceased to ask for the things which
caused friction, and there was a season of comparative
peace.</p>
<p>In July, however, a new phase of the old difficulty arose.
Nathan and Susan Hornby were driving past the Hunter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
house one Sunday afternoon. Elizabeth saw them and
with a glad little shout ran to the road to greet them.</p>
<p>Susan Hornby&#8217;s delight was fully equal to her own.
The two persuaded Nathan to wait till Aunt Susan should
have time to go into the house and see the baby. Nathan
would not go in, but sat waiting in offended aloofness in
the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come to see me, Elizabeth?&#8221; Aunt
Susan whispered as they went back to the wagon. &#8220;He&#8217;s
always loved you so, but he thinks&mdash;well, he&#8217;s always
been so good to me about everything else, but his feelings
are awfully hurt about you. Can&#8217;t you come soon?&#8221;
She looked into the girl&#8217;s face with such a wealth of pent-up
love that Elizabeth answered positively:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come next Sunday, Aunt Susan. You may look
for us, for we&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glad look in Susan Hornby&#8217;s eyes was a sad reproach
to the younger woman, and though Elizabeth
wondered how she would get her husband&#8217;s consent, she
made up her mind to force him by every means in her
power to comply. All through the week she had it upon
her mind, but Elizabeth had learned not to open a discussion
till the necessity of action was upon her, and it was
not till Sunday morning that she mentioned the visit to
John.</p>
<p>Nothing but the pleading in Susan Hornby&#8217;s face could
have induced Elizabeth to ask to be taken to see her at
this time, but the troubled whispering of Aunt Susan
about this visit had awakened Elizabeth to the tragedy of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
her neglect. Susan Hornby had never before whispered
where Nathan was concerned before. Elizabeth at last
saw the loneliness of the old couple. It would never do
to continue such treatment of those who had befriended
her when she was in need.</p>
<p>Jack was fretful that Sunday morning and John walked
the floor with him while Elizabeth finished her breakfast
dishes. The breakfast had been late and it was time to
get ready if they were to go. Her heart sank as she approached
the subject. Jack had not slept well of late.
He was not ill, but teething. Always a light sleeper,
Elizabeth had kept the fact of his indisposition to herself,
hoping that John, who slept soundly, might not be aware
of it, but the baby had fretted in the daytime and was
now tossing restlessly in his father&#8217;s arms. Elizabeth was
worn out from the loss of sleep and was half afraid to trust
herself to make the request, because it would require
politic treatment to get John in the mood. If she became
vexed or upset by his opposition she would lose her opportunity.
Elizabeth was weaker than John when her feelings
were ruffled. She had planned and waited till the
last moment, afraid of herself and afraid of her husband.
She looked at him as he paced back and forth, back and
forth, with a torrent of longing swelling up in her and
threatening to bring her tears. She must find a way to
get his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take Jack,&#8221; she said, hoping that something in
the conversation would give her a natural opening for
what must come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little chap,&#8221; John replied, releasing the child.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was bathed in perspiration from the hurry of
having late breakfast and the fact that she would never
dare to ask to be taken before all the work was done and
the kitchen ready for close inspection, and she thought
indignantly of the scrubbed floors of yesterday and wondered
how the child could be expected to be well when
he was fed on overheated milk day after day. Instantly
she put the thought away from her. She must
be cool and careful if she were to get to Aunt Susan&#8217;s
to-day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sponge him off with soda in his bath and he&#8217;ll be
all right. I told Aunt Susan we&#8217;d take dinner with them
to-day, and it&#8217;s nearly half-past ten now. They have
dinner at noon on Sunday as well as other days; so run
and hitch up, and I&#8217;ll be ready with baby. I&#8217;ll have your
things laid out so you can jump right into them when
you come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down at the baby so as not to meet his eye,
but the offhand assumption of his readiness to go seemed
to her to be encouraging.</p>
<p>&#8220;With that child?&#8221; was the astonished exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt him as much as for me to stand over the
stove and cook a dinner at home,&#8221; Elizabeth answered
firmly, &#8220;and, besides, John, I promised Aunt Susan we&#8217;d
come. Now don&#8217;t be cross. I&#8217;ve got to go, and that&#8217;s all
there is about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter was actually astonished now. He had
started out with his usual pretenses, but this was something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
new. Elizabeth had promised without consulting
him! What was happening?</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be willing to take that child out in his condition&mdash;I&#8217;m
not,&#8221; he said severely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
what you&#8217;re thinking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;m</i> thinking there&#8217;d be less harm to him in a day of
rest for his mother than anything else,&#8221; she said bitterly,
&#8220;and I am not allowed to get a minute of it in this house.
<i>You&#8217;d</i> let me heat his milk to the boiling point to get dinner
and think it was what we both deserved!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was instantly dismayed at what she had done.
She had spit out all the actuality of her convictions in spite
of every effort not to reply unkindly when he was unfair
to her. She could not afford to retort sharply to-day.
She must resort to other tactics if she were to win to-day.
Besides, the truth was only a half-truth. John did not in
his heart wish either of them harm; he was just a blind
sort of bossing creature who had somehow got into command
of her and enjoyed bullying her and setting tasks to
keep her occupied. He owned her, however, and she
must court his consent to this visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, dear. I told Aunt Susan we&#8217;d come. I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d
have told you before&mdash;only&mdash;only I was afraid you&#8217;d
not be willing&mdash;and then I&#8217;d get to crying and give up&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve got to go. Now don&#8217;t be cross. Go this once
good-naturedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get close to him she put her hand on his arm and put
up her face coaxingly for a kiss.</p>
<p>John Hunter ignored his wife&#8217;s signal for tender relations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
and shook off her hand impatiently without looking
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if Jack were well I wouldn&#8217;t go away and leave
mother alone all day.&#8221; John moved restlessly away from
her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth would not give up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage mother. She&#8217;ll go if I insist.&#8221; John was
edging toward the door. &#8220;Anyhow I told Aunt Susan
I&#8217;d come.&#8221; John was going through the door. &#8220;Please
hurry. We must be on our way pretty soon,&#8221; she called
after his receding back.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s lips tightened with vexation at the contempt
shown by his refusal to answer, and then loosened and
spread into an amused smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can be just as mad as he wants to. I stuck to it
and am going to get to go. It&#8217;s better than to give up to
him all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned into the sitting room and putting the baby on
the floor emptied the clothespin bag in his lap to keep him
occupied, and flew up the stairs to Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, we&#8217;re going to Aunt Susan&#8217;s to-day and you
are to go with us. Now don&#8217;t say you aren&#8217;t, for it is
settled,&#8221; she said, slipping her hand over the older
woman&#8217;s mouth to prevent the objection she saw coming,
but nothing she would do or say would persuade the older
woman to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll settle that with John when he comes in,&#8221; Mrs.
Hunter said, slipping away from the restraining hand.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why you should stay at home on my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
account and I will not have it done,&#8221; was all that she
could get out of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But John will not go without you!&#8221; Elizabeth cried
in dismay.</p>
<p>The girl was tempted to tell her of the gossip she had
heard, but it suddenly seemed small and not worth while.
She had already told her that Aunt Susan had her promise
to come in time for dinner; it occurred to her to tell her of
Nathan&#8217;s attitude toward them for their unfriendly
neglect, but that too seemed unnecessary and trivial since
they were going. On that point Elizabeth did not intend
to give in an inch: she was going, even if John <i>was</i> cross
about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he will go without me, for I&#8217;ll see that he does,&#8221;
Mrs. Hunter assured her, and with that Elizabeth was
content.</p>
<p>Taking the baby to her own room, she undressed and
bathed him and then arrayed him in the daintiest white
dress she had for him, determined that Aunt Susan should
see him at his best. As she nursed him so that he would
drop off to sleep till they were ready to go, she looked long
and earnestly at the soft skin and dark lashes of his baby
face and realized as she had never done before the loneliness
of the old couple whom they were going to visit.
The little Katie of that house had been taken from them
at about this age. A sob arose in Elizabeth&#8217;s throat when
she considered how they had besought her for an opportunity
to pour the dammed-up stream of their love at the
feet of this child, and how slighted their efforts had been.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>Jack was wide-eyed and would not sleep, and after
losing much valuable time his mother set him in the middle
of the bed and began her own preparations. As she
looked about for something suitable to wear, she saw a
simple white percale with red dots scattered over it, which
she had worn the summer she had lived in Aunt Susan&#8217;s
house. So little had she gone out and so free from personal
vanity was she that it was still eligible to best wear.
Besides, it had associations that were pleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I made it in Aunt Susan&#8217;s own house,&#8221; she said
aloud.</p>
<p>She looked down at it wistfully; those had been happy
days.</p>
<p>A sudden impulse made her drop her heavy hair from
its coil high on her head and, picking up her comb, divide
it with deft movement. Brushing it into shape, she
braided it as of old, in two braids, and then fished with
rapturous fingers in her ribbon box for the bows she had
always worn with that dress. When the bows were tied
she put the braids back with a characteristic toss of the
head and stood looking at herself in the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, he can&#8217;t be cross after that,&#8221; she said,
feeling more as if she were her real self than she had done
for many months.</p>
<p>Jack was restless and cried. Elizabeth turned to him
with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;You blessed baby! Your mother was way off and had
forgotten that there was such a small person as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down and nursed him again to fill in the time till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
his father should come and dress. This time he seemed
sleepy, and Elizabeth sang happily to him, kissing his pink
palm and satisfying the maternal instinct in her by softly
stroking his plump body. He had never looked so fair to
her in all the months that she had had him. John was
long in coming and she fell into a dreamy state of maternal
comfort as she rocked, and forgot the hour and the place
and the dinner that would soon be waiting at Aunt
Susan&#8217;s, till the baby went to sleep in her arms.</p>
<p>When Jack was at last soundly asleep she placed him on
the bed, covering him with a piece of white mosquito
netting to keep the flies from disturbing him, and, rearranging
dress and ribbons, went into the sitting room to
see what time it was. An exclamation of dismay escaped
her. It was but ten minutes to twelve o&#8217;clock! She had
dreamed much longer than she had been aware. In a
fever of hurry she ran back to the bedroom and laid out
John&#8217;s best suit. That had pleasant associations also.
But what could be keeping him so long when it was time to
go? As soon as everything was in order she ran to the
barn to see what the trouble was. John came out as
she neared the barn door, talking to Jake, who followed
leisurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready to dress?&#8221; she asked hastily, vexed at
the signs of loitering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress? Why&mdash;what? Oh, I forgot. I told you I
didn&#8217;t want to go,&#8221; he said impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going to take me if it is late,&#8221; she said
firmly. &#8220;Aunt Susan was told that we&#8217;d come, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
has dinner waiting this minute. Jake, put the horses in
the wagon while Mr. Hunter dresses, and be as quick
about it as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The horses&mdash;th&#8217; horses are in th&#8217; pasture, Lizzie,&#8221;
Jake said hesitantly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;I&mdash;an&#8217;
we turned &#8217;em out an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jake Ransom saw the colour die out of the young face
and understood exactly what had happened. He saw her
turn without a look at her husband and start to the house,
bowed and broken and without hope. Jake understood
that a trick had been played on her, for he had been slow
about turning the horses out and John had untied and led
the team used for driving to the pasture gate himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I kin ketch &#8217;em &#8217;r not, but I&#8217;ll
try,&#8221; he called after her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned back hopefully, but John said</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, Elizabeth, those horses have been
playing like mad for half an hour, and you could no more
catch them than you could fly.&#8221; Turning to Jake, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
take Mrs. Hunter next Sunday if she&#8217;s just got to go. A
man wants to rest when Sunday comes,&#8221; he added under
his breath.</p>
<p>Jake Ransom watched Elizabeth drag her listless feet up
the steps and shot a look of disdain at the back of John
Hunter as he followed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dirty cuss!&#8221; he exclaimed under his breath.
&#8220;Lizzie&#8217;s as good a woman as th&#8217; is in this country, an&#8217;
she don&#8217;t git nothin&#8217; she wants. I bet I see t&#8217; gittin&#8217; them
horses ready next Sunday myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>Going into her bedroom, Elizabeth Hunter laid off the
finery of girlhood, and with it her girlhood also.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never ask him again,&#8221; she told herself, and put her
hair back into its woman&#8217;s knot and went to the kitchen
and began dinner.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Susan Hornby shaded her eyes with her hand, and
looked up the road for the fortieth time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The baby must be worse, Nate,&#8221; she said to her husband
when at last there had to be a discussion of the
matter.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby followed her into the kitchen and
helped to take up the dinner which had been waiting over
an hour. His head burned with indignation, but there
was something in Susan&#8217;s defeat which brooked no discussion
on his side. They had come as near quarrelling
over this invitation as they had ever done about anything
in their married life.</p>
<p>As they sat at the table eating their belated dinner, a
lonely horseman appeared coming down the road from the
west.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Jake! I wonder if he&#8217;s going for the doctor?&#8221;
Susan exclaimed. &#8220;You never can tell what anybody has
to contend with.&#8221; And the meal was left to cool unfinished
as the old couple left the house and hailed the rider.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear nothin&#8217; about th&#8217; baby bein&#8217; worse,&#8221;
Jake was obliged to answer when put under question.</p>
<p>He was so conscious that Elizabeth would not approve
of the truth being told that he stammered and made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
his listeners feel that something was left untold. In fact,
Jake&#8217;s reticence was of the exact quality to add to the
distrust already aroused. He edged away at last and left
Susan Hornby looking at her husband in such a state that
Nathan was moved to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Sue, I&#8217;ll take you over after dinner and
you can see for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Hornby turned and started to the house.
Nathan followed her aquiver with the slight that his common
sense told him had been put upon her by those whom
she had so faithfully and fully served.</p>
<p>Susan stumbled and put her hands to her head with a
harsh laugh. Nathan hurried forward a step and looked
searchingly into her face. With a great sob, he put his
arms about her. Susan paid not the slightest attention
to him, but let herself be guided along the path without
actual resistance. Her face was flushed and her eyes did
not see. She went docilely to her room and permitted the
stricken husband to place her on the bed, where he
loosened her collar and, removing her clothing, dressed
her for bed as if she had been a little child. When nothing
more could be done, he knelt by her and fondling her
unresponsive hand let the tears he could no longer control
pour over his ashen cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me, Sue? Don&#8217;t you know your old
Nate at all?&#8221; he quavered, but there was no reply except
the puffing breath which was every moment growing more
and more laboured. Nathan knew what it meant&mdash;she
had been so once before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>As the Hunter family sat about the dinner table on
Tuesday, Silas Chamberlain drove up to the side gate,
and after tying his team came to the door. He entered
when bidden, but would not sit down, and looked about
him with an effort to adjust his impressions with what he
saw before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; t&#8217; th&#8217; funeral?&#8221; he asked when he saw
that there seemed to be no air of mourning in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funeral?&#8221; John Hunter exclaimed. &#8220;Who&#8217;s dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Nate Hornby you didn&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hornby? We haven&#8217;t heard of any one being dead.
Who is it?&#8221; John Hunter asked, puzzled at the reticence
of the old man, who stood with his straw hat in his
hand and slid his fingers about its greasy brim uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is it possible you all didn&#8217;t know Mrs. Hornby
was sick?&#8221; he asked, unable to lift his eyes.</p>
<p>There was a low cry from Elizabeth Hunter, the noise of
her escape to the privacy of her own room, the sound of
moans and cries after the door was shut, and Silas Chamberlain
paid bitter toll for delivering his message. The
family sat stunned and silent in the presence of those
sounds of grief. The bowed head of the old man told his
comprehension of the news and left Jake Ransom with an
understanding of him which words could never have given.</p>
<p>As soon as Elizabeth could get control of her feelings and
command her scattered senses, she snatched her bonnet
from the chair beside the bed where she had dropped it
before dinner and flew to the dining room again, her one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
impulse to get to the side of the friend whose spirit had
gone from her. Going to Silas, she clutched him by the
arm with fingers that sank into the flesh like a vise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me to her!&mdash;take me now!&#8221; she cried, pushing
him toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you, Elizabeth,&#8221; John Hunter said, rising,
and Jake Ransom saw the look of nameless horror she took
on at thought of her husband&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me to her at once, Mr. Chamberlain. Do, for
God&#8217;s sake, take me to her!&#8221; she cried, and pulled the old
man through the door with nervous hands, and then ran
down the path before him and began to pull at the straps
with which the horses were tied.</p>
<p>John followed them out, still protesting that he would
take her himself if she would wait, but without a look in
his direction she urged Silas on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry! Hurry! Do!&#8221; she implored, and Silas gave
the horses such a sharp slap with the lines that they
started on a swift trot almost before they were seated,
leaving John Hunter in the midst of his expostulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring her back safe,&#8221; Silas called over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Now that no further action was possible, Elizabeth sat
with her hands clasped, her teeth set, and her eyes looking
into vacancy, numbed beyond words, asking no questions
and making no complaints. Silas&#8217;s heart beat with an
anguish of sympathy. He stopped at his own house a
moment to tell Liza Ann that he would come back for her
within the hour, and still Elizabeth gave no sign of realizing
what was going on about her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>At last a terrible thought took hold of Silas, and he
pulled up his team, which was sweating heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t fit t&#8217; go, Lizzie. You ain&#8217;t fit t&#8217; go, child.
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; take you back home.&#8221; He began to turn the
horses&#8217; heads toward home, and then stopped for her wandering
wits to gather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, oh, why don&#8217;t you hurry?&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed
when she realized that they were standing still.</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s heart was torn with pity, and it was in
the voice of a mother that he addressed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t fit t&#8217; go,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I&#8217;m going t&#8217; take
you back home.&#8221; There was a white look about her
mouth that frightened him.</p>
<p>The girl grasped his arm with fingers that closed with a
grip like a drowning person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see her when she was living&mdash;surely I can
see her dead.&#8221; Then with a wail, &#8220;Oh, no&mdash;no, not dead!
Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>
<p>She sobbed in a dry sort of way that contracted Silas&#8217;s
throat to witness, and left the old man almost as undone
as herself, and without further argument he drove on to
Nathan Hornby&#8217;s desolated home, where he lifted her
tenderly down from the high seat, with a mist before his
eyes that blurred her image till it was unrecognizable, and
stood watching her go up the path.</p>
<p>A woman met her at the door, but she did not know
who, and brushed past her hurriedly and ran into the
kitchen, where she could see Nathan Hornby sitting with
his head on his arms beside the kitchen table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></p>
<p>Going down on her knees with a swift movement,
Elizabeth threw her arm across his shoulder, and laid her
head beside his, sobbing convulsively. Nathan raised his
head in dull surprise, and seeing who it was, shook her
arm off resentfully and rose to his feet. Elizabeth crawled
after him on her knees and clasped his own with both arms,
turning her stricken face up to his and crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! I know how you feel, but truly, truly,
Uncle Nate, I am not to blame. For God&#8217;s sake&mdash;for
God&#8217;s sake, forgive!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down on her coldly and was tempted to spurn
her from him with his foot, but there was such anguish in
voice and eye as he himself had hardly felt, and his wife&#8217;s
words, her last words, flashed through his bewildered
brain: &#8220;We can&#8217;t tell what anybody has to contend
with.&#8221; He stood irresolute while she rose to her feet.
When he did not answer her, Elizabeth threw herself
down in the chair from which he had just risen and
bowing her head on the table moaned in such bitterness of
spirit that Nathan was moved to pity, and would have
comforted her if he could.</p>
<p>Silas, having tied his team, came to the kitchen door,
but on seeing its occupants turned hastily and went out to
his wagon again, where he stood choking and swallowing
in helpless misery.</p>
<p>Presently, Nathan Hornby, at a loss to check her grief,
laid a hand on her shoulder and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and see her, Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter arose like one walking in her sleep and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
followed Nathan to the sitting room. The black casket
resting on two chairs in the middle of the room was a
worse shock than any she had yet had, and with a horror-stricken
cry of fright she fled to the kitchen again, and
when Nathan reached her side, her teeth were chattering
and great beads of sweat covered her quivering face; she
sank into Nathan&#8217;s chair unable to support herself.</p>
<p>When at last she was assisted tenderly to her feet, she
begged feebly to be taken home.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t ride that far,&#8221; Silas protested, pityingly.
&#8220;You just naturally can&#8217;t ride that far in th&#8217; big
wagon, child.&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer she dragged herself forward and staggered
to the chair where they had put her bonnet. Nathan saw
that her strength was returning and gave Silas a little nod.
They each took an arm to steady her, and so Elizabeth
passed from the presence of her one dear friend into a life
as colourless as the form she left behind.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an awful sick child, Mrs. Hunter, but we may&mdash;I
believe we will pull him through.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Thursday, and Doctor Morgan sat opposite
Elizabeth, holding the hand of the shadow of the baby of
three days ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see that milk has not agreed with him. Mr.
Hunter says you took a drive over to Hornby&#8217;s the day of
the funeral. The heat and excitement has been too much
for you. You nursed him immediately on getting home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied lifelessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have to wean him now,&#8221; the old doctor
said, looking the unresponsive mother over sharply. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t do to try any experiments with him. Your milk
may be all right now, but he wouldn&#8217;t stand a relapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no reply and listened patiently to his
directions for preparing the new food. After he was gone,
she laid the shrunken little body on the bed and went to
the kitchen to prepare the milk. She took up the new
bottle with the rubber on the end and looked at it in
stupefied, aimless disgust. Her impulse was to fling it
out of the open door, but remembering that she would but
poison him by putting his lips to her own breast, she
turned to the table and placing the bottle in a pan covered
it with cold water and set it on the stove to come to a slow
boil.</p>
<p>Going back to the bedroom she picked up the pillow&mdash;the
child was so limp that they had to handle him on a
pillow&mdash;and sat down, holding it close to her heart.</p>
<p>John came in. She did not look up. He came over to
her and stooped to look at the half-conscious child, who
lay with half-open eyes and under jaw dropped down.
There were deep greenish rings under those eyes, and a
great sob broke from John Hunter&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stirred dully and looked up, but did not speak.
There was that about her which made her unapproachable.
She showed no resentment, no anger, no emotion of any
sort. She had come home from Nathan&#8217;s house as she
was now. She had refused to go to the funeral, but she
had had supper ready when John and his mother had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
returned from the graveyard, and it had been as orderly
and as well cooked as usual, but she had not talked at the
meal, nor seemed to hear when she was spoken to, but
there was evidently no pouting. John had tried to explain,
and she had given silent opportunity, and when it
had been finished had said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; in a hollow voice, and
had moved on about her work without looking up, but
there had been no apparent resentment.</p>
<p>Before bedtime that night the baby (who had gone to
sleep while she had nursed him when she had come home),
awoke crying. She had taken him up and had offered her
breast, but it had turned away as if sickened, and had
continued to cry till, presently, it had doubled its little
body together with a sharp scream and vomited till its
breath was nearly gone. There had been a sour odour to
the contents of its stomach that had struck terror to their
hearts, and before morning Doctor Morgan was at its
side. He had noted the leaden movements of the mother
and calling John outside had questioned him regarding
her. John, troubled at her indifference to him and the
lifelessness of her attitude even toward the babe, had told
him all he knew&mdash;as he understood it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she boarded with them two years ago,&#8221; he
had said in concluding, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see that that needs to
cut such a figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were your wife and Mrs. Hornby great friends?&#8221;
Doctor Morgan asked, studying John Hunter and puzzling
over the evident mystery of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-s-s!&#8221; with perplexed deliberation; &#8220;that is, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
liked her better than any of the rest of the neighbours
around here. She wanted to go there last Sunday and I
thought the baby wasn&#8217;t fit to take out. It looks now as
if I was right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s had a shock of some kind, and if you don&#8217;t
look out She&#8217;ll be down on our hands too. You&#8217;d better
get a girl or let your mother do the work for a couple of
weeks,&#8221; Doctor Morgan advised.</p>
<p>And John Hunter had looked faithfully for some one to
take his wife&#8217;s place in the kitchen and had found what
she had told him when Hepsie left to be true. In many
places where there was no excuse given and girls were at
home he had met with a sort of refusal which stung him to
the quick.</p>
<p>Elizabeth rocked the baby with a mechanical dead sort
of care. John was emotional enough to be badly broken
up by the child&#8217;s looks, but Elizabeth&#8217;s unresponsiveness
at such a time made of it a tragedy which he could not
understand; he wanted greetings and discussion, and
attentions showered upon him as usual, and they were
not forthcoming. He could not understand what had
brought this state of things to pass, but no more could
he question one who was so evidently removed from
present conditions. With a sense of forlornness he had
never known, he fell on his knees by her side and laid
his head against her arm, seeking comfort, and when
she still did not speak, the fullness of his misery became
apparent, and he got up unsteadily and left the
house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>Slowly life and returning interest awakened in the child;
still more slowly did the mother take up her threads in the
web of living. The old routine was established, with a few
exceptions. Elizabeth arose early and prepared breakfast
before sunrise as before, the washing and ironing were
as well done, but when she prepared to clean the kitchen
floor the first washday after Aunt Susan&#8217;s death, she took
the mop down from its nail on the back porch and used it
as she had done that first winter.</p>
<p>John and his mother came in with the clothes basket
as she started to wring out the mop to wipe the first corner
finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I better get down and scrub it for you with the
brush?&#8221; John asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no more of that in my kitchen,&#8221; replied
Elizabeth, and she had quietly continued her work without
looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; had been the astonished query.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not argue it,&#8221; she had said in the same spiritless
tone in which she always spoke those days, and had
been so quietly determined that she got her way. John
could not argue with a woman who was so unresistant of
manner: to him, manner constituted argument. Elizabeth
went her own quiet way and took no part in the
things that went on about her unless her services were
required, then she served faithfully and uncomplainingly,
but she held converse with no one in the happy way of old.</p>
<p>Thus summer passed, and autumn also. Little Jack
walked now and was beginning to lisp an occasional word,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
making of himself a veritable fairy in the household.
With the close of the warm weather he grew less and less
fretful, and when the first snow fell he became as happy
and active as a kitten. The mother had kept him with her
every minute, and when her work had been done, which
was seldom, was satisfied to rock him and listen to his
baby chatter.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had not been angry in the whole six months,
neither had she been glad. She never vexed John by
asking to be taken places. Gladly would he have taken
her, if by so doing he could have brought back her old
enthusiasm and girlish glee, for Elizabeth had been the
life of the household, and things had settled into a dead
monotony that made of their home but a house since
Susan Hornby&#8217;s death. Sometimes, vexed by her passive
acceptation of whatever came, John would throw out
stinging observations about women who made their husbands
turn to others for their society, and then be left in
an uncomfortable situation by the fact that he had
aroused neither anger nor annoyance, for Elizabeth would
inquire in her lifeless tones what he wished her to do
which was left undone. Puzzled by her real meekness of
spirit, the man was compelled to admit that she made
no vexatious demands upon him and that she laboured
unceasingly to keep the soulless home in order. One of
the strange and contradictory things in the situation was
that John Hunter did not turn to the mother whom he
had ever been ready to exalt for consolation in this time
of trouble; the demand his feelings made was for the companionship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
which while it was his he had not desired.
The revelation of the months showed him what he had
lost. Mrs. Hunter was as much in the dark about the
real cause of Elizabeth&#8217;s changed condition as was John.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ride to Mr. Hornby&#8217;s had something to do with
it,&#8221; she said dubiously when talking the matter over with
her son after the baby began to get well and Elizabeth
showed no improvement in a mental way.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes from that ride in the hot sun. You see it
made the baby sick too; but it ain&#8217;t any use to say so to
her,&#8221; John replied, but in spite of the firmness of his tone
there was a puzzled look on his face and the last word
dragged with indecision.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was very fond of Mrs. Hornby, too, and that may
have had something to do with it,&#8221; Mrs. Hunter observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-s-s-s!&#8221; John replied. &#8220;But she couldn&#8217;t care for
that kind of people enough to make herself sick about
them,&#8221; he said more firmly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter considered slowly for some moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;She seemed
to be attached to them, but she don&#8217;t ask to go to see him
since his wife&#8217;s death; and I should think now&#8217;s when her
love for them would show out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to God she would ask to go anywhere. I&#8217;m
tired of the kind of life we&#8217;re leading,&#8221; John said in a
manner which supported his words.</p>
<p>The weariness of life was modified, or at least shifted
from one shoulder to the other for John Hunter by the
increasing burden of financial worries. In this also he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
was denied any comfort or assistance from Elizabeth; she
asked no questions, and if he talked of notes which were
falling due, or of interest soon to be paid, she listened without
remark, and moved about her endless round of cleaning,
cooking, or sewing apparently absorbed in the work
in hand. If he complained about expenses, the only reply
he received was for the food on the table to be of a plainer
quality and a lessened grocery bill the next time he went to
town. This he would not permit, being sensitive about
the opinions of the men who worked for him. Elizabeth
never remarked upon the matter of keeping three men
through the winter as she would have done a year ago
when there was little to do which counted in farm affairs.
She left her husband free to do as he chose on all those
matters. She did not sulk; she had lost hope, she was
temporarily beaten. In that first hour after her return
from Aunt Susan&#8217;s death chamber she had meditated
flight. She longed to get away, to go anywhere where she
would never see her husband&#8217;s face again, but there was
Jack. Jack belonged to his father as much as to her, and
Elizabeth was fair. Besides, she was helpless about the
support of the child. Her health was quite seriously
interfered with by the ache in her back which was always
present since the baby&#8217;s coming. She had told her mother
but two short years before that she would not live with a
man who would treat her as her father treated his wife,
and here she found herself in those few months as enmeshed
as her mother had ever been. Aye! even more
so. Hers was a position even more to be feared, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
it was more subtle, more intangible, more refined, and
John&#8217;s rule as determined and unyielding as that of
Josiah Farnshaw.</p>
<p>Having failed to act in that first hour of her trouble,
Elizabeth drifted into inaction. Even her thoughts
moved slowly as she pondered on her situation; her
thoughts moved slowly, but they moved constantly.
Under all that quiet of manner was a slow fire of reasoning
which was working things out. Gradually Elizabeth was
getting a view of the real trouble. Two things absorbed
her attention: one was the domination of men, and the
other was the need of money adjustment. To live under
the continual interference of a man who refused to listen
to the story of one&#8217;s needs was bad enough, but to live
without an income while one had a small child was worse.
She would leave this phase of her difficulties at times and
wander back to the character of the treatment she received
and compare it to that accorded to her mother. It
occasioned great surprise to find herself admiring her
father&#8217;s manner more than that of her husband. Mr.
Farnshaw had the virtue of frankness in his mastery,
John used subterfuges; Mr. Farnshaw was openly brutal,
John secretly heartless; her father was a domineering
man, her husband even more determined, more inflexible.
While considering the possibility of escape by running
away, many things were clarified in Elizabeth&#8217;s mind
regarding her position as a wife, and the position of all
wives. She, for the first time, began to see the many
whips which a determined husband had at his command,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
chief of which was the crippling processes of motherhood.
She could not teach school&mdash;Jack was too young;
neither could she take any other work and keep the child
with her. As she meditated upon the impossibility of the
various kinds of work a woman could do, another phase
of her situation arose before her: even if the baby were
older, and a school easily obtained, the gossip that would
follow a separation would be unendurable. Having
accumulated a reputation for snobbishness and aristocratic
seclusion, people would not neglect so rare an
opportunity to even old scores. She would be a grass
widow, a subject for all the vulgar jest and loathsome wit
of the community. Country people know how to sting
and annoy in a thousand ways. However, the possibility
of this sort of retribution was put entirely away by the
baby&#8217;s illness. By the time Jack had recovered, the
young mother was worn to a lifeless machine, compelled
to accept what came to her. Her youth, her health, her
strength were gone; worse than all that, her interest in
things, in her own affairs even, had almost gone.</p>
<p>John wandered about the house disconsolate and dissatisfied,
and made amends in curious little ways, and
from John&#8217;s standpoint. He opened relations with
Elizabeth&#8217;s family and insisted upon taking her home for
a visit. Elizabeth went with him, and accepted the more
than half-willing recognition of her father, who wanted to
get into communication with the baby. He was offering
for sale a young team and John, thinking to do a magnanimous
thing, bought Patsie. Elizabeth accepted the visit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
and the horse without emotions of any sort, and left her
husband annoyed and her family floundering in perplexity
at her passive attitude toward life. At home that night
he said to her sneeringly:</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what a man does for you, you pout, and act
as if you didn&#8217;t like it. If I don&#8217;t offer to take you you&#8217;re
mad, and if I do you set around and act as if you were
bored to death by having to go. What th&#8217; devil&#8217;s a man
to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was perfectly willing to go,&#8221; was the reply, and she
went on dressing Jack for bed without looking up.</p>
<p>John cast a baffled look at her as she carried the child
out of the room, and returned to his uncomfortable
thoughts without trying to talk of anything else when she
returned and sat down to sew. The sitting room in
which they spent their evenings was in perfect order; the
whole house was never so orderly, nor their table better
served, but John pined for companionship. The work he
had worn her out in doing was never better performed, but
there was no love in the doing, and when he addressed her,
though her answer was always ready and kind, there was
no love in it, and he was learning that our equity in the life
of another has fixed and unalterable lines of demarkation.</p>
<p>Thus matters progressed till February, when Jake was
called home to Iowa by the death of his mother. Jake
had lived such a careless, happy-go-lucky sort of life that
he was obliged to borrow a large part of his railroad fare
from John Hunter, who was himself so badly in debt that
he was wondering how he was to meet the interest which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
would fall due in May. John gave him the money with
the understanding that Jake would come back in time for
the early seeding, and prepared to take him into town.
Jake was the only man left on the farm, and there was
consternation in John&#8217;s heart at the prospect of having all
the chores thrown upon his own shoulders in cold weather.
Jake had been the only reliable man he had ever been able
to hire. The more independent sort of hired men resented
John Hunter&#8217;s interference in the farm work, which they
understood far better than he, and seldom stayed long,
but Jake Ransom liked Elizabeth, was close friends with
Luther Hansen, and since he saw the mistress of the house
drooping and discouraged, doubly appreciated the home
into which he had fallen. Jake had been devoted to
Elizabeth with a dog-like devotion since his first meeting
with her in the little schoolhouse six years before. He was
more than glad that he could secure his return to the
Hunter home by the simple method of borrowing money.
More nearly than any one else in her whole circle of
acquaintances, Jake Ransom had Elizabeth&#8217;s situation
figured out. He wanted to come back to her service, and
it was with a satisfied security that he helped prepare the
bobsled for the trip to town. They went early and took
Mrs. Hunter with them to do some shopping for herself
and Elizabeth. John hoped to find a man who could
come back with them that afternoon and help with the
work of watering and feeding the hundred and fifty head of
cattle that made of their farm life a busy round of daily
toil.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>HUGH NOLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Doctor Morgan folded his stethoscope and
thrust it into his inner pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your heart&#8217;s been pounding like that for
seven years, you say?&#8221; he asked of the man sitting before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven years in May,&#8221; was the brief answer.</p>
<p>The patient got up from the office chair and adjusted
his waistcoat. The waistcoat was ample and covered a
broad chest. The face also was broad, with a square chin,
and eyes set well apart. The man was twenty-eight or
thirty years old and nearly six feet in height.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all you&#8217;ve got to tell me,&#8221; he said, going to the
mirror to brush his tumbled hair. &#8220;They sent me out to
find a place on a farm because medicine wouldn&#8217;t do anything
for me. I&#8217;m tolerably comfortable if I don&#8217;t overdo&mdash;that
is, if I stay out of doors while I&#8217;m doing. I don&#8217;t
expect you to make a new man out of me; I only thought
I&#8217;d have you look me over the first thing, because I might
need you suddenly, and it&#8217;s better for you to know what
sort of patient you&#8217;ve got beforehand.&#8221; He paused for
an inspection of his well-groomed hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may not need me for years,&#8221; Doctor Morgan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
interrupted hastily. &#8220;That kind of a heart outlasts the
other organs sometimes. The doctor twisted the heavy-linked
watch chain which dangled from his vest pocket as
if calling upon it for words. Of course an out-of-doors
life is best. What have you been doing of late?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching in the old university since I got my degree,
but they&#8217;ve sent me out like a broken-down fire horse.
I&#8217;ll get used to it,&#8221; the young man said indifferently. He
was accustomed to signs of hopelessness when his case was
discussed, and was unmoved by them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you family ties?&#8221; the doctor asked. He liked
the grit this man&#8217;s manner indicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;None that need to be counted,&#8221; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>The doctor noticed that his patient wasted no extra
words in self-pity. &#8220;That&#8217;s good! It lessens a man&#8217;s
worries. And&mdash;where are you staying, Mr. Noland?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the hotel, till I get a place on a farm. Before I
invest I&#8217;m going to get my bearings about farms, by working
around till I get on to things. You don&#8217;t know of a
place where a man could work for his board for a month
till the spring seeding and things come on do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was pushing the cuticle back from his finger-nails
as they talked, and Doctor Morgan smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those hands don&#8217;t look much like farm work,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>The man laughed easily. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s habit. I&#8217;ll get
over it after a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will if you work for these yahoos around here
much. Why don&#8217;t you invest in land and have your own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
home right from the start? A man like you can&#8217;t live in
the kind of houses and do the kind of work You&#8217;ll find in
this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t work for myself&mdash;I&#8217;ve nothing to work
for. When you take away a man&#8217;s chances to marry and
live the normal life, you make a sluggard of him. I&#8217;ve
got to have a partner, and have his interests to serve as
well as my own, or I won&#8217;t work, and in the meantime I
want to look about a bit before I pick up some one to go
into business with. I won&#8217;t be long finding some one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No whine in him,&#8221; was the doctor&#8217;s mental comment,
but what he said was: &#8220;Well, You&#8217;ll find life about here a
bit dull. Come in, and make yourself at home in this
office while you&#8217;re in town, and I&#8217;ll see what I can do
about finding a place for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>After he had watched his patient swing off up the street
he considered the case seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;College athletics do just about that sort of thing for a
boy,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;Now I believe Silas Chamberlain
would take him for his board, and there ain&#8217;t any children
there. Children&#8217;s the devil in a farmhouse: no manners,
and they set right on top of you, and if you say anything
the folks are hurt. He&#8217;s a nice fellow, and I intend to hold
on to him. It was like old times to talk for a while to a
man that knows chemistry and things. I&#8217;ll see more of
him. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; old altogether too fast in this blamed
hole. I need some one to talk to that&#8217;s more like a man
ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>REVIVIFYING FIRES</h3>
</div>

<p>It was butchering day at Silas Chamberlain&#8217;s and
Liza Ann had the household astir early. Luther
Hansen was master of ceremonies in the backyard,
and relieved Silas of the heavy lifting. It was a day
for visiting and neighbourly activity as well as hard work.
Hugh Noland had been sent to Silas the week before by
Doctor Morgan, and assisted in rolling the pork barrel
from the cellar door to a convenient post near the out-of-door
fire, where they sunk the bottom of it into the frozen
earth and carefully tilted it to the proper angle for scalding
purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fifteen years since I&#8217;ve been at &#8216;a killing,&#8217; and I
feel as if I were ten years old again,&#8221; Noland said as he
watched the hard earth give way under the mattock
Luther wielded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go hunt a straw in that case, and I&#8217;ll see that you get
the bladder. Shall I save you the pig&#8217;s tail?&#8221; Luther
said as he settled the barrel into the cavity.</p>
<p>They swung the great iron kettle over the pile of kindling
and corncobs laid ready for lighting, and then carried
water to fill it.</p>
<p>As the last bucket was emptied into the kettle, Luther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
turned and swung his cap at John Hunter and Jake, who
were passing in the bobsled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunters,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Have you met them yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Noland. &#8220;Who are they? He drives a
good team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearest neighbours on th&#8217; west over there,&#8221; Luther
said, pointing to the roofs of the Hunter place, plainly to
be seen over the rise of land between. &#8220;They&#8217;re th&#8217; folks
for you t&#8217; know&mdash;th&#8217; only ones with book-learnin&#8217;
around here. Goin&#8217; t&#8217; stay with th&#8217; Chamberlains long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the other, with a look of reticence; &#8220;that
is, only for a time. He don&#8217;t hire much, he tells me. I&#8217;m
just helping him till he gets his fencing tightened up and
this work done. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was just a thinkin&#8217; that that&#8217;s th&#8217; place for you.
Hunter hires a lot of work done, and&mdash;and you&#8217;d like
each other. You&#8217;re th&#8217; same kind of folks. I wonder
how he come t&#8217; be takin&#8217; &#8217;is man along t&#8217; town with &#8217;im?
Th&#8217; was a trunk in th&#8217; back of the sled too, but that may
&#8217;a&#8217; been for Mrs. Hunter. That was &#8217;is mother with &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not much time to speculate about future
work, there was much to be done in the present, and before
noon five limp bodies had been dragged from the pens to
the scalding barrel, plunged into the steaming water,
turned, twisted, turned again, and after being churned
back and forth till every inch of the black hides was ready
to shed its coat of hair and scarf-skin, were drawn out
upon the wheelbarrow. Then a gambol-stick was thrust
through the tendons of the hind legs and the hogs were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
suspended from a cross pole about six feet from the ground,
where they hung while the great corn-knives scraped and
scratched and scrubbed and scoured till the black bodies
gradually lost their coating and became pink and tender
looking and perfectly clean. They were then drawn and
left to cool and stiffen.</p>
<p>The sloppy, misty weather made the work hard because
of the frozen earth under the melting snow, and the steaming,
half foggy atmosphere was too warm for comfort of
men working over an open fire and a steaming barrel of
hot water, but by noon the butchering was finished. To
the new man it was a journey back to childhood. How
well he remembered the various features of preparation:
the neighbours asked in to assist, the odours pleasant and
unpleasant, the bustling about of his mother as she baked
and boiled and stewed for the company, the magic circle
about the pens from which he was excluded when the men
went forth with the rifle, and the squeal which followed
the rifle&#8217;s crack, and the fear which gripped him when he
thought the poor pig was hurt, but which was explained
away by his father, who, proud of his marksmanship,
assured him that &#8220;that pig never knew what hit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that the man had spent his
childhood on a farm, he had the happy faculty of entering
into the life of the people among whom he found himself.
He entertained the little group at the dinner table that
day with a description of his mother&#8217;s soap-making, and
discussed the best ways of preparing sausage for summer
use as if he himself were a cook; and as Luther listened he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
was convinced that the Hunter home was the proper place
for him to settle down.</p>
<p>At two o&#8217;clock Luther started home with some spareribs,
wrapped in one of Liza Ann&#8217;s clean towels, under his
arm. It was early, but nothing more could be done at
Silas&#8217;s house till the carcasses were cold enough to cut and
trim, and, besides, there was an ominous looking bank of
dull gray cloud in the northwest. Luther swung along
the road toward the west energetically.</p>
<p>The wind gave a little twisting flurry, and dropped completely
when he was about halfway between Chamberlain&#8217;s
and the Hunter place. A few minutes later there
was a puff of wind from the opposite direction, succeeded
by a feeling of chill. Luther scanned the horizon and
stepped faster. When the advance guard of fine snow
began to sift down from the leaden sky above, he started
to run. He had lived in the north, and knew the meaning
of the rapidly darkening sky. The signs were unmistakable.
Presently the fine flakes began to rush along toward
the south with greater force. The wind came on steadily
now. Luther looked about anxiously, making a note of
the location of things. It was still a quarter of a mile to
Hunter&#8217;s. As he peered ahead, wishing himself nearer
protection, with a roar the blizzard fell upon him, blotting
out the landscape before him as completely as if a curtain
had fallen between.</p>
<p>With all his might Luther struggled forward. The
wind came from the right side and almost carried him
from his feet. He had been standing over a steaming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
kettle and scalding barrel most of the day, and the icy
blast went through him, chilling his blood instantly.
Luther knew his danger. This was not a cyclone where
men were carried away by the winds of summer; this was a
winter&#8217;s storm where men could freeze to death, and men
froze quickly in blizzards. The driving particles of snow
and ice made it impossible to look ahead. He shielded
his face with his right arm, and tried, as he hurried forward,
to keep in mind the exact direction of the Hunter
house. If he could only reach that he would be safe.
The road was a new one, recently opened, and not well
defined. It was almost at once obliterated. Little
needles of ice thrust themselves at him with stinging force,
and he could not see; the blinding snow whirled and
whistled about his feet, and in five minutes Luther Hansen
realized that he had got out of the road. He stopped
in alarm and, turning his back to the storm, tried to see
about him. The gray wall of snow completely obscured
every object from his sight. He had a sense of being the
only thing alive in the universe; all else seemed to have
been destroyed. His every nerve ached with the cold,
but peer about as he would he could not possibly tell where
he was. He remembered that there had been a cornfield
on his right, and thought that he must have gone too far
south, for he was certainly in the meadow now. The
pressure of the wind, he reflected, would naturally carry
him in that direction, so he faced around and started on,
bearing stubbornly toward the north. Every fibre in
him shook; no cold he had ever felt in Minnesota was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
equal to this; there was a quality in the pressure of this
cold that was deadly. The wind pierced in spite of every
kind of covering. Real fear began to lay hold upon him.
He stumbled easily; the action of his limbs began to give
him alarm. The package of spareribs fell from under his
arm, and he stooped to pick it up. As he bent over the
wind caught him like a tumble-weed and threw him in a
shivering heap on the ground. He had worn no mittens
in the morning, and his hands stung as if tortured by the
lashes of many whips. To ease their hurt he remained
huddled together with his back to the wind while he
breathed on his freezing fingers, but remembered that
that was the surest way to add to the nip of the cold in a
blast which condensed the breath from his mouth into icicles
before it had time to get away from his moustache.
Staggering to his feet, he stumbled on toward the Hunter
house, trying as hard as his fast benumbing senses would
permit to bear toward the wind and the cornfield at the
right. He had not picked up the package&mdash;had forgotten
it in fact&mdash;and now he tried to beat his freezing hands
across his shoulders as he ran. The bitter wind could not
be endured, and he crossed his hands, thrusting them into
his sleeves, hoping to warm them somehow on his wrists;
but with eyes uncovered he could not gauge his steps, and
stumbled and fell. Unable to get his hands out of his
sleeves in time to protect himself, he tripped forward
awkwardly and scratched his face on the cut stubs of the
meadow-grass. Evidently he had not reached the road as
yet. He knew the road so well that he could have kept it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
with a bandage over his eyes but for the wind which
thrust him uncertainly from his course. It was that which
was defeating him. Try as he would, he could not keep
his attention fixed upon the necessity of staying near that
cornfield. Determined to find it before he proceeded
farther toward the west, he faced the wind squarely, and,
bracing his body firmly, hurried as fast as he could toward
the stalkfield.</p>
<p>After a time he seemed to wake up; he was not facing
the wind, and he was aching miserably. Luther Hansen
knew what that meant: he was freezing. Already the
lethargy of sleep weighted each dragging foot. He
thought of the nest an old sow had been building in the
pen next to the one where the killing had been done that
day. With the instincts of her kind, the mother-pig had
prepared for the storm by making a bed where it would be
sheltered. Luther&#8217;s mind dwelt lingeringly upon its cozy
arrangement; every atom of his body craved shelter.
Death by freezing faced him already, though he had been
in the grip of the storm but one short quarter of an hour.
He had lost consciousness of time: he only knew that he
was freezing within sight of home. Nothing but action
could save him. Nerving himself for another trial, the
bewildered man turned toward the north and walked into
the very teeth of the storm, searching for the lost trail.
Sometimes he thought his foot had found it; then it would
be lost again. He wandered on hours, days, weeks&mdash;he
wandered shivering over the meadow, the road, the state
of Kansas&mdash;over the whole globe and through all space,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
till at last a great wall shut off the offending wind, the
roar of the planets lessened, and the numb and frozen man
fell forward insensible, striking his head against a dark
obstruction thrusting its shoulder through a bank of dirty
gray snow.</p>
<p>The sound of a heavy body falling on her doorstep
brought Elizabeth Hunter to the door. She opened it
cautiously. The snow swirled in as it was drawn back
and the heated air of the sitting room rushed out, forming
a cloud of steam which almost prevented her from seeing
the helpless figure at her feet. She could not distinguish
the features, but it was a man, and the significance of his
presence was plain. Seizing him about the body, Elizabeth
dragged him into the house, and shut the door behind
him to keep out the blast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther Hansen!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Finding that she could not arouse him, she pulled the
relaxed and nerveless form to the lounge, but when she
attempted to lift the limp figure to the couch she found it
almost more than all her woman&#8217;s strength could accomplish.
Luther stirred and muttered, but could not
be awakened sufficiently to help himself, and it was only
after some minutes and the putting forth of every
ounce of strength that the girl had that he was at last
stretched upon the lounge. Elizabeth brought blankets
to cover the shivering, muttering, delirious man,
and having heard that the frost must be drawn gradually
from frozen extremities, and being unable to get
his hands and feet into cold water, she brought and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
wrapped wet towels about them, and chafed his frozen
face.</p>
<p>It was a long time before the white nose and cheeks
began to show colour; then the ears became scarlet, and
pain began to sting the man into consciousness. The
chafing hurt, and Luther fought off the hands that rubbed
so tenderly.</p>
<p>Gradually Luther Hansen awoke to his surroundings.
Delirium and reality mixed helplessly for some moments.
He remembered his struggles to reach the Hunter house,
but the gap in the train of his affairs made him suspect
that this was a phase of delirium and that he was
in reality freezing. He was stinging all over. He
wanted to find out where he was, and tried to get upon his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right here in my house, Luther,&#8221; Elizabeth
said, holding him on his pillow.</p>
<p>Luther relaxed and lay looking at her for some time
before he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How did I get here, Lizzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Luther,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I heard you
fall on the doorstep. I never was so surprised. How did
you come to be out&mdash;and without mittens too?&#8221;</p>
<p>She removed the wet towel from one of his hands, and
he drew it away with a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect, Lizzie, it&#8217;s frozen. You better rub it with
snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question of how he reached her house puzzled
Luther throughout the long afternoon and evening, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
they listened to the roar of the wind and talked of the
unsheltered cattle in the many Kansas stalkfields.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that kept our cattle from being out of
doors was the fact that Jake had to go to Iowa and John
had to take him to town,&#8221; Elizabeth had said at one
point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Jake left for good?&#8221; Luther asked hesitatingly.
He knew John&#8217;s unpopularity with the men who worked
for him and was a little afraid to ask Elizabeth, who might
be sensitive about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Jake has lost his mother, but he&#8217;ll come back for
the spring seeding. Jake&#8217;s a good man; he and John
seem to get along pretty well.&#8221; It was Elizabeth&#8217;s turn
to speak hesitatingly. She did not know how much
Luther knew of John&#8217;s affairs with his men, nor what
opinion Jake might have expressed to Luther.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake&#8217;s a curious cub! He&#8217;s been your dog, Lizzie,
ever since that school business. I&#8217;ve heard &#8217;im tell it over
twenty times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could find another like him,&#8221; Elizabeth said
wistfully. &#8220;John isn&#8217;t able to take care of all this stock
unless he gets a man in Colebyville to-day, and&mdash;and if
he did, the man, as likely as not, wouldn&#8217;t stay more than
a week or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther Hansen looked up eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, I&#8217;ve found th&#8217; very man for you folks. He&#8217;ll
stay too. He&#8217;s a fellow by th&#8217; name of Noland&mdash;workin&#8217;
for Chamberlain, an&#8217; wants a job right soon&mdash;got a lot of
book-learnin&#8217;&mdash;just your kind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have John see him when he gets home,&#8221; Elizabeth
answered indifferently. &#8220;My! I wonder when they will
be able to get back?&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wasn&#8217;t through tradin&#8217; when this thing come on,&#8221;
Luther replied. &#8220;Anyhow, houses was too thick t&#8217; get
lost th&#8217; first half of th&#8217; way. Listen to that wind, though!
I&#8217;m glad t&#8217; be here if I do look like a turkey gobbler with
these ears,&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>It was so cold that Elizabeth had built a roaring fire,
and to keep the snow, which penetrated every crack, from
sifting under the door, she laid old coats and carpets across
the sill. She brought coal and cobs from the shed, stopping
each trip to get warm, for even to go the twenty steps
required to get to the cobhouse was to experience more
cold than she had ever encountered in all the days when
she had plowed through the snows of Kansas winters while
teaching; in fact, had the fuel been much farther from her
door she would hardly have ventured out for it at all in a
wind which drove one out of his course at every fresh step
and so confused and blinded him that the points of the
compass were a blank, and paths could not be located for
the drifts, which ran in every direction the swirling wind
chose to build them. She had gone around the shed to the
back door, knowing that the front door being on the windward
side could not be shut again if once opened, and the
few extra steps necessary to creep around the building
froze her to the bone, for the eddying wind had carried the
snow deep at that point and, being enough sheltered to
prevent packing, had left it a soft pile into which she sank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
almost to her waist. She was obliged to hunt for a shovel
and clear the snow out of the doorway when she was
through, and her hands were completely numbed when
she reached the house after it was over. With the feeling
that she might not be able to reach the shed at all in the
morning, or that the doors might be drifted shut altogether,
Elizabeth had taken enough cobs and coal into
the kitchen to half fill the room and was ready to withstand
a siege of days, but she paid toll with aching hands
and feet that frightened Luther into a new realization of
the nature of the storm.</p>
<p>When at last the one fire Elizabeth thought it wise to
keep up was rebuilt and dry shoes had replaced the wet
ones, she settled down beside the lounge, with her feet in
another chair to keep them off the cold floor, and turned to
Luther expectantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This storm&#8217;s awful, as you say,&#8221; she said in reply to
his observation that it might hold for days, &#8220;but I&#8217;m just
so glad of a real chance for a visit with you that I&#8217;m quite
willing to bring cobs and keep fires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s true, why don&#8217;t you come t&#8217; see us as you
ought t&#8217;, Lizzie?&#8221; Luther said, looking her searchingly in
the eye. &#8220;I never meddle in other people&#8217;s business, but
you ain&#8217;t th&#8217; stuck-up thing folks says you are. Honest
now, why don&#8217;t you do as a neighbour should?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s face flushed crimson and she leaned
forward to tuck the old coat, in which she had wrapped
her feet, more closely about them while she took time to
get herself ready to answer the paralyzing question. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
longer she waited the harder it became to meet the kindly
questioning eyes bent upon her, and the more embarrassing
it became to answer at all. She fumbled and
tucked and was almost at the point of tears when Jack,
who was asleep on a bed made on two chairs, began to
fret. Seizing the welcome means of escape, she got up
and took the child, sitting down a little farther away from
Luther and hugging the baby as if he were a refuge from
threatened harm.</p>
<p>Luther felt the distance between them, but decided to
force the issue. He came about it from another quarter,
but with inflexible determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Sadie got her kindling in before the storm
began. It&#8217;ll be awful cold in th&#8217; mornin&#8217;, and&mdash;I do
wish I could &#8217;a&#8217; got home. Sadie&#8217;s fires always go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cobs are closer to the house than mine; Sadie &#8217;ll
get along all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know where our cobhouse is now, Lizzie?
You ain&#8217;t seen it for over a year,&#8221; Luther observed quietly.
And when Elizabeth did not reply, said with his eyes
fastened on Jack&#8217;s half-asleep face: &#8220;I wonder how
Janie is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad to talk of anything but herself and her own affairs,
Elizabeth answered with feverish readiness the last half of
Luther&#8217;s observation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never told me what the baby&#8217;s name was before.
Isn&#8217;t it sweet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Lizzie, that Sadie &#8217;d most made &#8217;er
mind up t&#8217; call it after you, if it was a girl, if you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
t&#8217; be with &#8217;er when it was born, as you said you would?&#8221;
Luther looked at her almost tenderly, and with a yearning
beyond words.</p>
<p>&#8220;After me? She didn&#8217;t send for me when she was sick,
Luther.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but she would &#8217;a&#8217;, if you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; come as you ought
t&#8217; &#8217;a&#8217; done them months when she wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; out.&#8221; He
looked at her penetratingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been anywhere since Aunt Susan&#8217;s death,&#8221;
Elizabeth evaded, determined not to recognize his trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could &#8217;a&#8217; come before her death, there was plenty
of time. Now look here, I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; beat about th&#8217;
bush. I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; square. You can&#8217;t git away from me.
You&#8217;ve had th&#8217; best chance a woman ever had t&#8217; help
another woman, an&#8217; you didn&#8217;t take it. Sadie was that
took by what you said about bein&#8217; glad for th&#8217; chance t&#8217;
have your baby, an&#8217; th&#8217; idea of helpin&#8217; him t&#8217; have th&#8217;
best disposition you could give &#8217;im, that she didn&#8217;t talk of
nothin&#8217; else for weeks, an&#8217; she looked for you till she was
sick, an&#8217; you never come. I want t&#8217; know why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter had come to the judgment-bar; she
could not escape these cross-questions, neither could she
answer. Her face grew white as Luther Hansen looked
searchingly into it, and her breath came hard and harder
as he looked and waited. This chance to talk to Luther
was like wine to her hungry soul, but John Hunter was her
husband and she refused to accuse him even after the long
months of despair she had suffered at his hands. Luther
let her gather herself for her reply, not adding a word to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
the demand for truth and friendship. How he trusted her
in spite of it all! He watched her indecision change to
indignation at his insistence, and he saw her head grow
clear as she decided upon her course.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not discuss the past with you, Luther,&#8221; she said
slowly, as one who comes to a conclusion as he proceeds.
&#8220;I cannot tell you all the things which have led up to it.
I am going to ask you not to mention it to me again, but
I will try to do it better next time. I had no idea that
Sadie cared whether I came to see her or not; she had always
seemed to dislike me.&#8221; Elizabeth added the last
hesitatingly lest she hurt Luther&#8217;s feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, I won&#8217;t be put off. If you don&#8217;t want t&#8217; tell
me <i>why</i> you&#8217;ve done as you have, I won&#8217;t ask you t&#8217;, but
you&#8217;ve got t&#8217; let me talk t&#8217; you about it all th&#8217; same. I
ain&#8217;t a man t&#8217; let myself mix up in my neighbours&#8217; affairs,
but, Lizzie, you ought t&#8217; live up t&#8217; th&#8217; things God&#8217;s put int&#8217;
your power t&#8217; do. Now, then, you let folks get a wrong
idea of you. You&#8217;ve got more education &#8217;n anybody else&#8217;s
got in this country, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve got more money, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve
got more everything &#8217;n th&#8217; rest of us, an&#8217; what&#8217;s it been
give t&#8217; you for if it ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; come t&#8217; nothin&#8217;? Here
you&#8217;ve had th&#8217; best chance t&#8217; do somethin&#8217; for a neighbour
woman a woman ever had: Sadie&#8217;s been that took with th&#8217;
things you said about children that she was ready t&#8217; listen
t&#8217; you on anything, an&#8217; you won&#8217;t let &#8217;er have a chance t&#8217;
get at you at all&mdash;an&#8217; ain&#8217;t she come out? You&#8217;d have
t&#8217; live with &#8217;er, Lizzie, t&#8217; know what that little woman&#8217;s
done fur herself this last year&mdash;an&#8217; it was you that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
helped t&#8217; do it. Honest, now, don&#8217;t you see yourself that
if you&#8217;ve had things give t&#8217; you that th&#8217; rest ain&#8217;t had
that you owe somethin&#8217; t&#8217; th&#8217; rest of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>In all the weary discordant time when she had struggled
for better conditions Elizabeth Hunter had never thought
of anything in the situation but the bettering of her own
surroundings. It had been the suffering of blind stupidity,
of youth, of the human being too deeply submerged to
think of aught but personal affairs. Luther drew her
attention to the main facts of her life, drawing her away
from self. It was a simple occurrence, a simple subject, a
simple question: it was in itself the reason for the perpetuation
of their friendship. The winds blew, the snow found
its way under door and sash and heaped itself in ridges
across the floor, and in spite of the roaring fire they were
not always warm, but throughout the night Elizabeth sat
beside her lifelong friend and drew in a revivifying fire
which was to remould and make over a life which had
almost flickered to a smouldering resentment and inactivity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>ADJUSTING DOMESTIC TO SOCIAL IDEALS</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning the wind blew the fine snow in
one vast driving cloud; it was impossible to see a
hundred feet. Elizabeth knew that the stock was
suffering, but was almost certain that she could not reach
them. It would not be hard to reach the barn, since the
wind would be with her, but to return would be a different
matter. To feel that she had done all that she could, she
went as far as the gate, and when she could not see the
house from that point was sufficiently warned and struggled
back to safety. No sound but that of the storm came
to her even at the gate, but she was certain that the
famishing cattle were calling for food. Her day was consumed
in the care of Luther&#8217;s inflamed hands and feet.
The only remedy she knew was wet cloths and she worked
anxiously to reduce the swelling and congestion.</p>
<p>About four o&#8217;clock the wind dropped. Though the air
was still full of fine snow, Elizabeth wrapped herself in
John&#8217;s old overcoat and muffler, and putting a pair of
Jake&#8217;s heavy mittens on her hands, and taking the milkpails
on her arm to save a trip back for them, she went
to the barn.</p>
<p>The barn door stuck, with the snow which had collected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
in the runway, and she had to fumble for some time
before it would come open. A perfect babel of voices
greeted her. Jake had left the south door of the barn
ajar when he left that morning, and the eddying snow had
banked itself along the entire centre of the building.
Patsie stood in the stall nearest the door, humped up with
the cold, and with a layer of snow on her hips and spreading
black tail. She turned sidewise and pawed furiously,
giving shrill little whinnies as Elizabeth seized a half-bushel
measure and waded through the snow to the oats
bin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, corn&#8217;s better this cold weather,&#8221; the girl said
aloud, and hurried to the other bin. Soon the horses
were making noise enough to inflame the appetites of the
other animals, who redoubled their cries.</p>
<p>She investigated the pens and found the hogs in good
condition, but the drifts so high as to make it possible for
them to make neighbourly visits from pen to pen, and even
into the cattle yard. It was a struggle to carry the heavy
ear corn from the crib to the pens, but it was done, and
then Elizabeth turned her attention to the excited cattle.</p>
<p>Taking time to rest and get her breath, Elizabeth
noticed that a few of the hogs had not come to get their
feed, and went to investigate the cause. They seemed to
be fighting over some choice morsel on the far side of the
cattle yard. At first she thought that it was one of their
number that they were fighting about, but as she approached
the knot, one of them ran off to one side dragging
something, its head held high to avoid stepping on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
grewsome thing it carried. One of the young cows had
lost her calf in the freezing storm, and the hogs were fighting
over its torn and mangled body. Elizabeth sought
out the little mother, and segregating her from the herd,
drove her into the straw cow-stable, where she would be
sheltered. The other milch cows had been left in their
stalls by the men the day before, and snorted and tugged
at their ropes as the newcomer appeared. Elizabeth tied
the heifer, and then shut the door after her and returned
to the unprotected herd outside.</p>
<p>The fodder was so full of snow that it was impossible for
the girl to handle it at all, so she dug the ladder out of the
snow and placed it against the long hayrick beside the
fence and forked the hay over into the racks below. It
required every ounce of strength she had to throw the
hay clear of the stack and in line with the racks where the
cattle could reach it, but the girl worked with a will, while
the cattle fought for best places, or any place at all, and
reached hungry tongues for the sweet hay.</p>
<p>Elizabeth worked with joy and energy. The mood of
the storm was upon the girl. Not before in all the months
she had been married had she ever moved in perfect freedom
in her native out-of-doors element. It was a gift of
the gods and not to be despised or neglected, for to-morrow
would come John&mdash;and prison bars. Before she had
begun, she faced the wind, and with bounding joy looked
over the drifted fields toward the north and northeast.
The air was clearing. The world looked different from
this lofty position. She was Elizabeth again, Elizabeth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
transformed and made new. The lethargy of recent
months had slipped away; something about the rush and
motion of things in the last twenty-four hours inspired
her; the fierce winds of yesterday and to-day stirred her
spirit to do, to be in motion herself. They had communicated
their energy, their life, their free and ungoverned
humour. Elizabeth&#8217;s thoughts ran on as fast as her
blood. She thought of Luther, and of all he had said to
her, of her neglected opportunities which he had pointed
out to her, and wondered modestly if he were right, and
then knew that he was. She thought of how she, the out-of-door
prisoner of her father&#8217;s home, had become the
indoor prisoner of her husband&#8217;s home. She had thought
that to marry and escape her father&#8217;s grasp was to possess
herself; but Elizabeth Hunter saw that as a wife she was
really much less free. She thought of the sacrifices she
had made in the hope of securing harmony, and she
thought of the futility of it all. She decided that if a
woman were enslaved it was because she herself permitted
it, that to yield where she should stand fast did not
secure a man&#8217;s love, it only secured his contempt and
increased his demands. In the three years she had been
married she had not been permitted an hour of real companionship
until the accident of this storm had brought an
old friend to her door and kept him there till she had had
a chance to realize the mental depths to which she had
fallen in her isolation. In all the time she had been
married she had not thought of anything but the bare
details of their daily life. A woman had to have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
association of congenial people to keep her from falling
into housekeeping dry-rot. For thirty-six hours she had
possessed herself, and in that time she had renewed her
youth and acquired a new outlook. As she stood looking
across the fields, her eyes fell on Nathan Hornby&#8217;s chimney.
The wind had dropped so completely that the air
had cleared of snow, and the curling smoke from a freshly
built fire arose in the frosty air, sending a thrill of homesickness
through her as she pictured the orderly kitchen
in which that fire was built. Was it orderly now that
its guardian angel was gone? The hideous cruelty of a
neglect which kept her from knowing whether it was well
kept swept over her. Once she would have spent herself
in emotionalism and tears at remembrance of it, but
Elizabeth had advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see him to-morrow, or as soon as the roads
are fit,&#8221; was her resolve. &#8220;Luther&#8217;s right; he usually is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cattle calling from below brought her back to the
necessities of the hour. Laying hold of the frosty pitchfork
she renewed her attack upon the hay and continued
till the racks were filled. By the time the ladder was put
away again her hands were stinging till it was impossible
to work, and she ran to the barn where she could put them
against Patsie&#8217;s flank while she blew her warm breath
upon them. Patsie was ticklish, and twitched her loose
hide nervously and gnawed at her feed-box with little
squeals of excitement. The feed-box was of two-inch
lumber instead of the usual sort. It was like all John did:
so much attention put in one place there was no time for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
the rest; well done, but much left undone. Everything
about John&#8217;s barn was orderly and well built. There had
been a time when she had rejoiced at what seemed to be
thrift, but to-day she saw it from a new angle; Mr. Farnshaw
had wastefully let his machinery rot and his stock
perish from cold, but here was wastefulness of another
sort; Elizabeth speculated on the cost of this barn and
thought of the interest to be paid.</p>
<p>On her way to the cow-stable where the little mother
whose calf had fallen a victim to the cold awaited her, she
thought of the toolroom where she had gone for her feed.
A forty-dollar set of harness hung there: Carter&#8217;s harness
had chains instead of leather tugs, and would outwear
them several times over. It was an orderly toolroom: the
bridles occupied a row over the collars, hames and back-bands
came next, and on the other side of the room, on
six-inch spikes, hung extra clevises, buckles, straps, and
such materials as accidents to farm machinery required.
John&#8217;s mending was well provided for and well done.
Elizabeth would have loved just this sort of order if it
had not been so costly.</p>
<p>The little cow was so hungry that she hardly knew that
she was giving her milk into a foreign receptacle till a voice
at the stable door made her jump so violently that the pail
was knocked over and Elizabeth had to scramble hastily
to avoid a similar fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, there you be! Gosh-a-livin&#8217;s!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas Chamberlain never finished that speech. The
milk from the rolling pail spattered over his feet as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
sprang to Elizabeth&#8217;s rescue. The little cow tore at the
rope that held her, and every mate she had in the stable
joined her in snorting and threatening to bolt over the
mangers. The old man, &#8220;So-bossied,&#8221; and vented all the
soothing cattle talk he could command while he looked on
in embarrassed confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now ain&#8217;t that jes&#8217; like me?&#8221; he queried in dismay.
&#8220;Look what I&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; done!&#8221; He picked up the
empty pail and handed it to the man that was with him
to keep it from being trampled upon by the plunging cows,
while he tried to establish confidential relations with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Mr. Chamberlain. She&#8217;s only a heifer
and never milked before. She wouldn&#8217;t have let me get
that far without trouble, anyhow, if she hadn&#8217;t been so
hungry. The hogs killed her calf last night or this morning
and I thought I&#8217;d milk her before I began on the rest.
I don&#8217;t suppose John can get home before to-morrow
night, and the chores had to be done. Here, there&#8217;s an
extra bucket or two. Do you want to help milk? they&#8217;ll
quit fussing in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course I do. That&#8217;s what Noland an&#8217; I come for.
This is Mrs. Hunter, Noland,&#8221; Silas said, remembering
formalities at the last moment. &#8220;We thought John
wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; got back &#8217;fore th&#8217; storm come on. Now let&#8217;s
get this milkin&#8217; done &#8217;fore dark or we&#8217;ll be havin&#8217; t&#8217; ask for
a lantern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Mr. Chamberlain, I forgot to tell you that Luther
Hansen got caught in the storm and nearly froze,&#8221;
Elizabeth said when they had settled themselves to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
work. &#8220;He&#8217;s at our house now; his feet and hands are
awful. I think they&#8217;re all right, but I wish we could get
at Doctor Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man nearly upset the milk a second time in his
astonishment, and the milking was cut as short as could
decently be done so as to get to the house. The early
winter night had settled down and the sting of the cold
was paralyzing as they hastened in. Silas went straight
to Luther, and Elizabeth and the new man brought a
fresh supply of coal and cobs before they went in. They
met Silas coming out as they carried the last basketful
from the shed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; right over t&#8217; tell Sadie,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;I
brought Noland over to help, but Luther says you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; t&#8217; need &#8217;im right along, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll jes&#8217; leave &#8217;im for good.
You&#8217;ll like each other an&#8217; he&#8217;ll want t&#8217; stay as bad as
You&#8217;ll want &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas had poured the whole arrangement out, and as it
was about what was necessary it was accepted.</p>
<p>The presence of a stranger necessitated more formal
housekeeping, and when the new man came back from
helping Silas saddle Patsie he found the kitchen in order
and the savoury smell of fresh biscuits and ham. A
small table was placed beside Luther, and the ham and
hot things had a seasoning of brilliant, intellectual conversation,
for the man from college was adept at entertaining
his fellow men and showed his best powers.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was too tired to stay awake long and she left
him and Luther chatting, after she had shown Mr. Noland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
where he was to sleep and had filled the cold bed with hot
flatirons to take the chill from the icy sheets. However
happy she may have been while feeding the stock, she had
to acknowledge that the loss of sleep the night before and
the unaccustomed use of the pitchfork had made of her
bed a desirable place. She awoke when the stranger went
up the stairs, but was asleep before his footsteps had
reached the room above her. A tantalizing remembrance
of his face disturbed her for a moment, but only for a moment,
and then tired nature carried her back to the land of
dreams. She had seen him somewhere, but where, she
was too sleepy to think out.</p>
<p>The next morning Silas came with his bobsled and they
helped Luther into a chair and carried him in it to the
sled and so to his home. John and his mother came a
little after noon, and the girl watched to see how her husband
would like the new man, half afraid that because she
had secured him in John&#8217;s absence that he would not like
him, and she wished it might be possible to keep him with
them. She need not have worried, for Hugh Noland had
looked about the place and decided to make himself so
necessary to its proprietor that his presence would be
desired, and he had gifts which favoured him in that
respect. Besides, John had been unsuccessful in obtaining
help and was overjoyed to come home and find the
cattle fed and everything at the barn in good order.
Patsie and her mate were hitched to the lumber wagon
and stood waiting in the lane when John came and Jack
was being wrapped in his warmest cloak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where on earth are you going?&#8221; John asked in profound
astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Mr. Noland to hitch up and take me to Uncle
Nathan&#8217;s, but now that you are here, you can go if you
wish,&#8221; Elizabeth replied quietly. &#8220;I should have gone a
long time ago. Will you go along mother, or will you stay
at home after climbing these drifts all day? I think now
that you&#8217;re at home we&#8217;ll take the sled instead of the
wagon. You won&#8217;t mind making the change, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She ended by addressing the new man, and it was all so
naturally done that John Hunter swallowed whatever was
uncomfortable in it. He would not go himself, and
Elizabeth set off with the stranger, glad of the chance to
do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive right home and help with things there.
What time shall I come back for you?&#8221; Noland asked
as he set her on the ground as near Nathan&#8217;s doorstep as
he could get the team to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till after five. Mother&#8217;s there and I&#8217;ll let her get
your suppers, and I&#8217;ll get mine here with Uncle Nate.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was such a perfectly normal arrangement that Hugh
Noland did not guess that there was anything new in it.
He drove away with a feeling of disappointment because
he had been unable to draw her into conversation on the
way over. She had proven herself a good conversationalist
at meals and he looked forward to a time when he
would be a permanent part of that household. Luther
and Silas had been right. Here was the partner he was
looking for if he could only make himself appreciated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span></p>
<p>He had laid out every faculty and put it to the best use
for that purpose and had been a bit disconcerted to have
her suddenly become uncommunicative.</p>
<p>Nathan was at the barn; he saw them stop and recognized
his visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; he snorted in disgust. However, a man
could not leave a woman with a baby in her arms standing
on his doorstep on a raw February day.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Uncle Nate?&#8221; the girl said timidly as
soon as he was near enough to accost.</p>
<p>Nathan&#8217;s greeting was short and inhospitable. He did
not offer to shake hands, nor pretend to see the hand she
extended to him. Instead, he opened the door and
invited her gruffly to enter. Closing the door behind
them, he went to the stove and began to stir the fire
industriously.</p>
<p>Elizabeth saw that she must have the difficulty over at
once or her courage would wilt. Setting Jack on the floor,
she went to Nathan and put her hand on his arm detainingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have fire enough, Uncle Nate. Let me talk to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>The girl was staggered by the nature of her reception.
It was worse than she had expected. Luther Hansen&#8217;s
estimate of the real situation had been only too right.
She stood before Nathan Hornby trembling and disconcerted
by the wall of his silence. The old kitchen clock
ticked loudly, she could hear her own pulses, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
freshly stirred fire roared&mdash;roared in a rusty and unpolished
stove. Dust lay thick on the unswept floor.
Nathan needed her. She would win her way back to his
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nate, I don&#8217;t blame you one bit if you aren&#8217;t
nice to me. I haven&#8217;t deserved it, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you needn&#8217;t &#8216;Uncle Nate&#8217; me any more,&#8221; he
said when she paused.</p>
<p>His speech was bitter and full of animosity, but it was
better than his compelling silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you one bit for being mad at me&mdash;&mdash;I
should think you would be. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going
to say to you either, but I&#8217;ve come to beg your forgiveness,&#8221;
she stammered.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby did not speak, but waited coldly for her
to continue. There was plainly no help offered her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t explain, Uncle Nate&mdash;I am going to call
you so&mdash;you&mdash;you shall not put me away. I have
come for your forgiveness and&mdash;and I&#8217;m going to stay
till I get it. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t explain&mdash;there&mdash;there are
things in life that we can&#8217;t explain, but I&#8217;m innocent of
this stuck-up business you think I&#8217;ve had. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve
loved you and Aunt Susan. Oh, Uncle Nate, I&#8217;ve loved
her better than I ever did my own mother,&#8221; she ended
with a sob.</p>
<p>There was the voice of honesty in what she said, but
Nathan remembered his wrongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, why didn&#8217;t you come t&#8217; see &#8217;er?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If you loved &#8217;er, why&#8217;d you let &#8217;er go down to &#8217;er grave a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
pinin&#8217; for you? She looked for you till she was crazy
&#8217;most, an&#8217; she never got a decent word out of you, nor a
decent visit neither. If you loved &#8217;er, what&#8217;d you act
that way for?&#8221;</p>
<p>The memory of that last day, when his wife had yearned
so pitifully for this girl, arose before him as he stood there,
and shook his faith in the honesty of Elizabeth&#8217;s purposes
in spite of the earnestness of her manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the one thing I cannot explain, Uncle Nate,&#8221;
Elizabeth answered. &#8220;I&mdash;I was all ready to come that
day and&mdash;and&mdash;then I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She buried her face in her hands at the memory of it
and burst into tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true that Hunter won&#8217;t take you anywhere?&#8221; he
asked pointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been listening to the Cranes,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been listenin&#8217; t&#8217; more&#8217;n them,&#8221; he said with the
fixed purpose of drawing her out on the subject. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been listenin&#8217; t&#8217; some as says you&#8217;re too high and mighty
t&#8217; associate with th&#8217; likes of us&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve heard it said
that your husband won&#8217;t take you nowhere. Now I just
naturally know that a man can&#8217;t shut a woman up in this
American country, so&#8217;s she can&#8217;t go anywhere she wants
t&#8217;, if she wants t&#8217; bad enough; an&#8217; I remember how Hunter
was &#8217;fore &#8217;e married you; &#8217;e was always on th&#8217; go&mdash;an&#8217;
there&#8217;s a nigger in th&#8217; woodpile somewheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was for the moment staggered. What he said
was so true. And yet, how untrue! It was hard to think
with the eye of suspicion on her. Appearances were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
against her, but she was determined not to discuss the
privacies of her married life. She paused and looked
Nathan squarely in the face till she could control her
reasoning faculties.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is neither here nor there,&#8221; she said quite firmly
at last. &#8220;I shall not defend myself to you, Uncle Nate,
nor explain away bad reports. It would not help me and
it would not help you. What I am here for is to offer you
my love <i>now</i>. What I want you to believe is that I mean
it, that I&#8217;ve wanted to come, that I&#8217;m here because I want
to be here, and that I never mean to neglect you again.
I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t come to see her&mdash;but, oh, Uncle Nate,
mayn&#8217;t I come to see you? I can&#8217;t tell you all the little
ins and outs of why I haven&#8217;t come before, but you must
believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth ended imploringly.</p>
<p>The man was softened by her evident sincerity in spite
of himself, and yet his wound was of long standing, his
belief in her honesty shaken, his beloved wife in her grave,
assisted to her final stroke by this girl&#8217;s neglect, and he
could not lay his bitterness aside easily. He did not speak.</p>
<p>The silence which followed was broken only by the
ticking of the old-fashioned Seth Thomas clock and the
roar of the fire.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked around the familiar room in her
dilemma, entangled in the mesh of her loyalty to her husband&#8217;s
dubious and misleading actions. Nearly every
article in that room was associated with some tender
recollection in the girl&#8217;s mind. Not even the perplexity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
of the moment could entirely shut out the reminiscent
side of the occasion. The bread-board, dusty and unused,
leaned against the flour barrel, the little line above it
where the dishtowels should hang sagged under the weight
of a bridle hung there to warm the frosty bit, the rocking
chair, mended with broom wire after the cyclone, and on
its back Aunt Susan&#8217;s chambray sunbonnet where it had
fallen from its nail: all familiar. With a little cry Elizabeth
fell on her knees by Nathan Hornby&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Nate! you can&#8217;t tell what others have to
contend with, and&mdash;and you must not even ask, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She could not proceed for sobs.</p>
<p>Nathan Hornby&#8217;s own face twitched and trembled with
emotion. The girl had unconsciously used Susan&#8217;s own
last words. His heart was touched. Susan&#8217;s great love
for Elizabeth pleaded for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I come, Uncle Nate? Won&#8217;t you be friends
with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nathan Hornby, who wanted her friendship,
answered reluctantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes-s-s&mdash;come along if you want t&#8217;. You won&#8217;t
find it a very cheerful place t&#8217; come to, but she&#8217;d be glad t&#8217;
know you&#8217;re here, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack, sitting in his shawls and wraps on the floor, began
to cry. He had been neglected long enough. His mother
got suddenly to her feet. Both stooped to take the baby.
Elizabeth resigned him to Nathan, instinctively realizing
that Jack was a good advocate in her favour if Nathan
still retained fragments of his grievances. She let the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
man retain him on his lap while she busied herself about
him unpinning his shawls.</p>
<p>It was home-like and companionable to have a woman
and baby in the house, and Nathan Hornby had been lonesome
a long time. He clucked to the baby and began to
trot him up and down on his knee. With a relieved sigh
Elizabeth dropped into a chair and watched them.</p>
<p>Jack, unaccustomed to whiskers, put his hand out to
investigate. Nathan waggled his chin to shake its pendant
brush, and Jack started nervously. Nathan looked
across at Elizabeth and laughed. That little laugh did a
world of good in aiding Elizabeth&#8217;s plans. It was not
possible for Nathan to catch her eye in good-natured
raillery and remain cool of manner; that laugh and the
glance that went with it did much to wash away his hurt.
In his secret soul Nathan had craved Elizabeth&#8217;s love and
Elizabeth&#8217;s baby. She had been like a daughter in the
house. He had missed her almost as much as his wife
had done, but he had resented her long absence. He had
come to the house determined not to forget his wrongs,
and here he was, in less than fifteen minutes, smiling at
her over the head of the baby in friendly amusement.
He was puzzled now at the readiness with which he had
given in, but Nathan found his love stronger than his
grievances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your things, Lizzie; th&#8217; house&#8217;s yours if you&mdash;if
you really want it to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth took off her wraps and prepared to begin
work on the disorderly kitchen. Aunt Susan&#8217;s limp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
apron hung on the nail from which the bonnet had fallen,
and she put it on, looking about her, undecided where it
was best to commence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to help&mdash;where shall I begin?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could tell you what t&#8217; do I could &#8217;a&#8217; done it myself,&#8221;
Nathan said ruefully.</p>
<p>Elizabeth thought of the orderly wife who was gone and
a sob arose in her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Nate! You don&#8217;t know how I miss her
sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nathan Hornby replied sadly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I kind a think maybe I do.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The night was cloudy and the long diagonal drifts made
it hard to drive after dark. The chores had kept Noland
later than he had thought and it was dusk when he
arrived at Nathan&#8217;s for Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland had been spending the afternoon with
John Hunter about the barn, measuring him and talking
of farm prospects. Here was the place for him to settle
down, if he could arrange for a partnership. He was so
much convinced of this that he was endeavouring to make
the alliances of friendship before he led up to the more
serious one. It had baffled him to have Elizabeth answer
in monosyllables both going to Mr. Hornby&#8217;s and again
during their return; he wanted to talk. Her home was the
first farmhouse he had ever entered that he felt could be
home to him; its evidences of culture and refinement had
made as lasting an impression upon Hugh Noland as that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
same home had done upon Elizabeth when John Hunter
had taken her to see his mother in it. It was an oasis in
the rural desert. He meant to exert every effort to
establish himself in it. When Elizabeth did not respond
to his attempts at conversation, he fell back upon the
analysis of herself and her husband which had been going
on in his mind all day. They were evidently not people
who felt above their neighbours on account of their
superior education, for she had gone to spend a whole
afternoon with that plain old farmer and she had shown
the liveliest interest, even friendship, for the Swede on the
other side of the farm. He liked them the better for that.
If a man or woman lived in a community he or she
should be a part of that community. Hugh Noland
never doubted that the friendly interest he had witnessed
was the regularly established course of action and that
it was mutual in the household. Coming into the household
at this transition point, he was to make many such
mistakes in his estimates.</p>
<p>John Hunter was at the side gate to assist his wife and
baby out of the sled. He left Elizabeth to carry Jack
to the house and went to the barn to help Noland put the
team away. This man, who took milking as a lark, and
all farm work as a thing to be desired, and yet was a
gentleman, was to John Hunter, who scorned these things
as beneath himself, an anomaly. It had never occurred
to John that labour of that sort could have dignity, nor
that a man could choose it as a livelihood unless driven
to it. It had never occurred to him that if driven to it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
one should enter into it as a real participant. To him it
was a thing to endure for a time and never refer to after it
could be put behind him. The beauty of the dawn, the
pleasant odours of new-mown hay, the freshness of the
crisp air, the association with the living creatures about
him, the joys of a clean life, all escaped him. Hugh
Noland had enumerated these things, and many more,
while they had worked together that afternoon, and John
Hunter accepted the enumeration, not because it was
fundamentally true, but because it was the estimate of a
cultured and well-educated man.</p>
<p>John Hunter had been vexed at Elizabeth for the sangfroid
with which she had walked away from established
custom in ordering the team prepared for her to be taken
to Nathan&#8217;s, but with Noland present he had accepted it
without remark. Here was a man before whom John
would always, but instinctively rather than premeditatively,
endeavour to show his best side.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland went to the house with John, talking
farm work and prices of produce as if they were matters
of pleasant as well as necessary importance, and he set
John to talking in his best vein and without superciliousness;
he had the faculty of bringing out the best in the
people he met. He brought some of his books&mdash;he
had stopped at the Chamberlain homestead for his
trunk on their return that evening&mdash;and added them to
those already on the Hunter shelves. While arranging
them, he sat on the floor before the bookcase and glancing
over the titles of those belonging to the family, opened an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
occasional one and read aloud a verse or a paragraph or
two. He read with zest and enthusiasm. He was fresh
from the world of lectures and theatres, and the social life
of the city, and became a rejuvenating leaven for this
entire household.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Luther was on Elizabeth&#8217;s mind when she awakened the
next morning, and as soon as the breakfast work was
finished and she had time to get the house in order, she
decided to move from her new standpoint and go to see
him. To this end she asked Mrs. Hunter to keep Jack
while she was gone, and to the older woman&#8217;s objections
that she should let the men hitch up the sled and drive
her over she answered firmly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a word said about it. I will go whenever
I please without arguing it with anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her secret soul she was glad to get past the barn without
John seeing her. She would not have permitted him
to stop her, or delay her visit, but a discussion with her
husband was apt to hold surprises and she to become
confused and angry, and worsted in the <i>manner</i> of her
insistence. To get away without having to explain put
her in good spirits.</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly and the air, though snappy and
cold, was brisk and fresh. It was the first free walk of a
mile Elizabeth had ever taken since her marriage. Elizabeth
was herself again. She skirted around the long
drifts as she crossed the field humming a snatch of tune
with all her blood atingle with the delight of being alone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
in the vast silent fields. The mere passing of time since
Aunt Susan&#8217;s death had gradually worked a change in
her condition, which Luther&#8217;s presence and the stimulating
quality of his words, John&#8217;s absence, the intoxication
of the wild and unfettered storm, the visit to Nathan
Hornby&#8217;s, and the invigorating personality of Hugh Noland
had combined to rejuvenate in the crushed and
beaten girl. Life held meanings to which she had long
been blind. Elizabeth set about the reorganizing of her
life with no bitterness toward John, only glad to have
found herself, with duty to herself as well as others still
possible.</p>
<p>Sadie Hansen met Elizabeth at the door with such
evident uneasiness that Elizabeth was moved to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther&#8217;s all right, Sadie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes-s-s!&#8221; Sadie replied slowly, and with such reluctance
that Elizabeth was puzzled.</p>
<p>Sadie took her to the bedroom and shut the door behind
her as tight as if she hoped to shut out some evil spirit in
the action. Her manner filled Elizabeth with curiosity,
but she crossed to Luther and held out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you &#8217;uns begin,&#8221; Sadie said with the air of
burning her bridges behind her, and before any one had
had a chance to speak, &#8220;I want t&#8217; tell you something. I
could &#8217;a&#8217; told it in th&#8217; kitchen,&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;but I
made up my mind last night that I&#8217;d have it out with both
of you. I&#8217;ve done you th&#8217; meanest trick, Lizzie. Luther
said you was goin&#8217; t&#8217; Hornby&#8217;s yesterday. Did you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth, standing at the head of Luther&#8217;s bed, nodded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
in her surprise, feeling that her visit with Nathan was not
a subject to which she could lend words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, Lizzie, if what I said t&#8217; th&#8217; Hornbys
has made any difference, I&#8217;ll go t&#8217; him an&#8217; take it back
right before your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes opened in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Nate did not mention it to me,&#8221; Elizabeth
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve made up my mind I want t&#8217; tell it, an&#8217; have
it off my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie considered a moment and then plunged into her
tale hurriedly, for fear that her courage would cease to
support her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when I was to your house last summer, an&#8217; you
told me about th&#8217; effect it had on a baby t&#8217; have a mother
that never got mad, I come home an&#8217; tried t&#8217; do everything
I thought you meant an&#8217;&mdash;seems t&#8217; me I never was s&#8217;
mean in my life. Mean feelin&#8217; I mean. I got along
pretty well at first&mdash;I guess it was somethin&#8217; new&mdash;? but
th&#8217; nearer I got t&#8217; th&#8217; time, th&#8217; worse I got. I scolded
Luther Hansen till I know he wished he&#8217;d never been
born. Th&#8217; worst of it was that I&#8217;d told &#8217;im how&mdash;what a
difference it made, and he was that anxious&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther raised his hand to protest, but Sadie waved him
aside and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t defend me, Luther!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been meaner &#8217;n you know of.&#8221; Turning to Elizabeth
again, &#8220;I used t&#8217; look over t&#8217; your house an&#8217; feel&mdash;an&#8217;
feel &#8217;s if I could only see you an&#8217; talk a while, I&#8217;d git
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
over wantin&#8217; t&#8217; be s&#8217; mean, but you wouldn&#8217;t never come t&#8217;
see us&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t feel&#8217;s if&mdash;I didn&#8217;t feel free
t&#8217; go any more, &#8217;cause ma said you didn&#8217;t want t&#8217; be
sociable with our kind of folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie paused a moment to crease the hem of her apron
and get the twitching out of the corners of her distressed
mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at last, when you didn&#8217;t come, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t git
no help from no one, I just said every mean thing I could.
I told Hornby a week &#8217;fore his wife died that you said you
didn&#8217;t want t&#8217; change visits with us country jakes, &#8217;cause
you wanted your boy t&#8217; be different from th&#8217; likes of us.
Ma&#8217;d heard that somewhere, but I told it t&#8217; &#8217;im &#8217;s if you&#8217;d
said it t&#8217; me. Sue Hornby put &#8217;er hand on my arm an&#8217;
said, so kind like, &#8216;Sadie, ain&#8217;t you &#8217;fraid t&#8217; talk that way
an&#8217; you in that fix?&#8217; An&#8217; I just cried an&#8217; cried, an&#8217;
couldn&#8217;t even tell &#8217;er I&#8217;d tried t&#8217; do different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther Hansen had been trying to interrupt the flow
of his wife&#8217;s confession, and broke in at this point by
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadie&#8217;s nervous an&#8217; upset over&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; Sadie replied hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been as
mean as mud, an&#8217; here she&#8217;s took care of you, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve gone
an&#8217; got Hornby mad at &#8217;er. He believed what I told, if
&#8217;is wife didn&#8217;t. They say, Lizzie, that &#8217;e lives there all by
&#8217;iself an&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Sadie choked, and waited for Elizabeth
to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve worried about nothing,&#8221; Elizabeth said
brightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to see him, and we&#8217;re good friends&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
best kind in fact, and no one could ever make us
anything else hereafter.&#8221; She looked down at Luther
and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it make any difference with my baby?&#8221; Sadie
asked anxiously, her mind working like a treadmill in its
own little round.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Sadie&mdash;that is, I guess not. I&#8217;ve been thinking,
as I listened to you, that the way you tried would have to
count&mdash;it&#8217;s bigger than anything else you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie Hansen dropped into a chair sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s hand went to the girl&#8217;s shoulder comfortingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;God does not ask that we succeed, Sadie; he asks that
we try.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Elizabeth was back in her own kitchen in time to get
dinner. John had seen her as she came home, but made
no remark.</p>
<p>At the end of three weeks there was a consultation
between Hugh Noland and John regarding a possible
partnership. Not only did Noland like John Hunter, but
he was delighted with the atmosphere with which he found
him surrounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a home,&#8221; had been Hugh&#8217;s secret analysis of
the household. In fact the home was the main feature of
the Hunter farm, the main reason for wishing to stay.</p>
<p>To John the offer of partnership was a blessing from
heaven itself. The matter of interest was pressing on him
far more than he had acknowledged to Elizabeth. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
galled him to discuss things with her since she had ceased
to ask about them or even to show any concern. He did
not realize that she had been compelled to consider the
matter hopeless.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Hugh should lift the indebtedness
and have one half interest in the concern, land and stock.
There would be about five hundred dollars left over after
all the debts were paid, and John gleefully decided to buy
some more calves with the residue.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we shall need every cent of that for running expenses
this summer,&#8221; Noland objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, if we do, we can always get money on sixty
or ninety day loans,&#8221; John replied easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not go into debt, with my health,&#8221; the new
partner said decidedly.</p>
<p>He happened to look across at Elizabeth and caught the
alert sign of approval in her face. He had heard Silas and
some others discuss the Hunter mortgages, but here was a
still more significant evidence. Elizabeth had not signalled
him, but the look told the story; in fact, it told
more than the girl had intended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should consider it a necessary condition of any business
I went into,&#8221; he added steadily. &#8220;I am an uncertain
quantity, as I have told you, with this heart, and I could
not be worried with debts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not look at him this time, but he saw the
look of satisfaction and heard her indrawn breath. And
now the really lovable side of Hugh Noland began to
show out. Feeling now that he was a real member of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
family, he began to give himself to its pleasing features.
The evening&#8217;s reading became a thing to which the whole
group looked forward. The flow of companionship exceeded
anything any member of the family had ever
anticipated. Jake arrived in time for the spring work, as
he had agreed, and was astonished by every feature of
the family life which he saw about him. Elizabeth was
cheerful, even happy, while John Hunter was another
man. Jake figured out the changes about him wistfully,
craving a part in the good-fellowship. Here was contentment
such as Jake had never witnessed. Not a
trace of the old tragic conditions seemed to remain. Jake
had missed the key to the situation by his absence at the
time of the blizzard, but he was keenly aware that
some change had been wrought. He studied Hugh
Noland and was even more enthusiastic about his personality
and powers than the family. All called the new man
by his given name, a sure sign of their affection.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had worked a radical change in her life.
Jake watched her come and go without remark from her
husband, give her orders to Hugh to hitch up for her if
she chose to drive, or if she walked, going without permission,
and was almost as pleased as she. He saw that
she had learned to keep her own counsel and not to speak
of her plans till the time for action had arrived. He felt
a something new in her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had, in fact, learned that while openness was
a point of character, nevertheless, if she dealt openly with
her husband it led to quarrelsome discussions. She saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
that John did not know why he opposed her, that it was
instinctive. As she studied him, however, she found how
widely separated they were in spirit. The calm which
Jake saw, was all there, but there were other things fully
as vital which had not been there before. The self-questioning
of those months previous to Aunt Susan&#8217;s
death had been productive of results. While a certain
openness of attitude had disappeared, there was the
strength which has all the difference between deceit and
reserve in Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE CHILD OF HER BODY</h3>
</div>

<p>In the spring Elizabeth&#8217;s affairs, which had promised
to straighten out, were complicated from a
new quarter. She was now to test her strength
against the greatest of all problems for women and to
find out if she could put her precepts into practice. The
probability of a second child had become a certainty;
the necessity of adjusting her good-will to accidental
child-bearing was upon her. Often and often her words to
Sadie&mdash;&#8220;I always wanted my baby&#8221;&mdash;rose up to accuse
her. Only of late had suspicion become a certainty.
Elizabeth did not greet that certainty with joy. Life was
hard; she had more work to do already than she was able
to perform; try as she would she could not get her mental
consent. Why must she have this undesired child?
When the thought first wormed its way into her head,
Elizabeth passed from disappointment to self-accusation.
By every law of God and man a mother should want her
child; if she did not, then she stood accused at Nature&#8217;s
bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;For its sake I&#8217;ve got to want it; I&#8217;ll make myself,&#8221;
she decided. But she did not want it, and found to her
growing dismay that she could not make herself satisfied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
about it. Instead of becoming reconciled, the question
enlarged and grew and gained in point and force. The
girl decided that she would be glad in spite of every opposing
thing, but her resolution was formed with tears in her
heart, if not in her eyes, and the weary ache in her back
never ceased. &#8220;It must not be so. My child must be
welcome!&#8221; Elizabeth told herself each morning, but she
was too tired; it was not welcome, and all her efforts failed
to make it so.</p>
<p>John was vexed when he found her in tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Now if we were too poor
to feed and clothe it there&#8217;d be some excuse, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
made his pause as expressive as he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that. I&mdash;I&#8217;m so tired and&mdash;I ought to be
glad&mdash;and&mdash;and I&#8217;m not,&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose with mother gone&#8221;&mdash;Mrs. Hunter
had returned to her old home on a visit&mdash;&#8220;you <i>have</i>
got a good deal to look after, but I&#8217;ve got to get to the
field now. You&#8217;re always raking something up that
looks wrong to you. If you&#8217;d stick to your work and
not run around looking for trouble you&#8217;d be able to want
it, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The force of her husband&#8217;s suggestion struck the girl.
Perhaps it was true that she had missed the very highest
for herself in loving ease and comfort enough to seek
them. To put discontent away from her and to keep her
thoughts occupied she began the spring housecleaning.
There was so much regular cooking and milk work that
only one room could be attacked at a time, but she kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
busy, and the plan worked admirably during the day.
She was not sleeping well, however, and found that nights
have a power all their own. When the lights went out,
thought held the girl in its relentless grip. It was of no
use to lengthen her working hours in the hope that sleep
would come more promptly, for the more exhausted
Elizabeth became the less able was she to sleep, and
thought stared at her out of the darkness with eyes like
living coals.</p>
<p>Wherever Elizabeth turned this monster confronted
her, this monster whose tail was a question mark, whose
body obscured everything on the horizon of the immediate
future except its own repulsive presence, and threw her
back upon the suffering present and the much to be deplored
past. Was it right to permit a child to come
when joy had gone out of relations between its parents?
This question grew and ripened and spread, and whenever
she summoned up enough will-power to weed it
out for an hour it would spring up anew, refreshed and
more tenacious than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s right or not for John and me to have a
child after we&#8217;ve quit loving each other, if I can only be
glad it&#8217;s coming, or even be willing to have it, I won&#8217;t
mind, now,&#8221; she told herself. But she was not glad,
and she was not even willing. She dragged herself
about, keeping busy day after day as her husband
had advised; it was her only refuge, and one
which could not avail very long, for already she was
worn out. On the last day of the cleaning, Hugh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
Noland came to the door of her room and speaking from
the outside said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I came in to see if I couldn&#8217;t help you a little in getting
ready for those shellers, Mrs. Hunter.&#8221; Hugh had
noticed her weary look of late, and, as all the men about
the house did, tried to help whenever there was time to
be spared from the fields or when extra work was required
of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shellers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth backed out of the closet she was cleaning,
and came around to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shellers? Are we going to have shellers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; he said in surprise.</p>
<p>In spite of her exclamation of astonishment Elizabeth
noted a familiar look on Hugh Noland&#8217;s face which had
something in it that always caught her attention. Always
when an unexpected thing came upon Hugh,
Elizabeth had a sense of having had past relations with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t tell me you didn&#8217;t know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely didn&#8217;t. When did John go to see the men
about it? Why, I haven&#8217;t even bread baked!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny! Well&mdash;I suppose he forgot to tell
you. The men passed here before dinner and he went out
to the road and engaged them. We&#8217;ve got a little corn
left over, and prices seem to be up this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s only one of many things,&#8221; she said, trying
to smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span></p>
<p>Her eyes wandered over the disordered bedroom as
she considered. Clothing, boots, shoes, and other articles
of apparel lay scattered over the bed. Her orderly soul
could not leave them without finishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what you do&mdash;I&#8217;ll straighten up here.
You go over to Uncle Nate&#8217;s and get me some yeast. I&#8217;ll
have to bake. I made him some yeast the last time I
made for myself, and he&#8217;ll have some left. It&#8217;s been too
damp and cloudy to make any of late. Then I&#8217;ll see what
you can do,&#8221; she said wearily. &#8220;I surely will need help
if I&#8217;ve got to have a dozen extra men without notice.
I suppose John forgot. He&#8217;s usually thoughtful about
the cooking for strange men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in the hurt, weary look of her went to Hugh
Noland&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run over to Hornby&#8217;s and back in half an hour
unless he&#8217;s at the far side of the field. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll get
back the very first minute I can. I have to start to
Mitchell County to-morrow, early in the morning, so I
won&#8217;t have any time to do anything except to-night. I
can kill the chickens for you, and bring things up out of
the cellar. What on earth made anybody put a cave as
far from the kitchen door as that for is more than I can
see,&#8221; he said, taking vengeance on the first unpleasant
feature of her circumstances that presented itself.</p>
<p>Hugh did not at all understand why she was sick and
unequal to the demands made upon her strength, but he
did see that she was so, and that her tired young face wore
a discouraged expression.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take Jack with me; that&#8217;ll help some,&#8221; he said as
an afterthought.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The relief in her voice told the
strain it was upon her to work and watch the toddling
child. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you&mdash;hurry back and tack this carpet
down for me. I&#8217;ll have the room and closet straightened
up so that you can do it by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wiped Jack&#8217;s dirty face with the end of a towel she
thrust into the water pitcher on the washstand and sent
him off with a kiss to the welcome ride. As she worked
after they were gone, she ran over in her mind the supplies
on hand for the feeding of fifteen men on such short notice.
Threshing and corn-shelling meant hard work to the men
who followed the business, but it meant feasting and festivity
as well, and it was with the prospect of much cooking
on the morrow that Elizabeth furrowed her forehead,
and hurried with the replacing of the contents of the closet.
There was a sponge to be set to-night and bread to bake
to-morrow; there was a cake to be baked, beans picked
over and set to soak, and dried fruit to stew; also, and
what was more annoying, she had let the churning run
over for twenty-four hours in order to finish her cleaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t get around to that churning, I&#8217;ll just let it go
if it does sour,&#8221; she decided at last.</p>
<p>When Hugh came back she set him to work at the carpet
and went to the kitchen to look after things there.
Nathan had offered to keep Jack when he heard of the
unexpected work his mother was going to have thrust
upon her, and Hugh, remembering Elizabeth&#8217;s relieved expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
when he had offered to bring the child, was only
too glad to leave him in such good hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is that child going to stay at Hornby&#8217;s?&#8221;
John demanded the next morning. He set the heavy
cream jar on the table and faced Elizabeth, who was
kneading the bread on the big bread-board which rested
on the top of the flour barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;till Uncle Nate gets time to bring him
home to-day, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not look up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want this thing to happen again. A
child that age has no business away from home. What
was your idea, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Hugh. I didn&#8217;t have anything to do with it. I
didn&#8217;t even know it till he got back. He knew you
had engaged the shellers without giving me any notice,
and he knew I had too much for any woman to do.
Uncle Nate knew it too. Go on, and don&#8217;t bother me
this morning; I&#8217;m so tired I can&#8217;t talk about it, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter was instantly apologetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, if Hugh did it I suppose he meant well. He
got off all right. I look for some results with that
Mitchell County land if he goes into it right. I&#8217;ll send the
cattle down as soon as he has time to get the fences in line
and a man to look after them. I brought this cream up;
it won&#8217;t keep any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>John lifted the lid of the cream jar and sniffed with disapproval.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll just put it into the churn for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! what did you bring it up for to-day? I
can&#8217;t churn with all I&#8217;ve got to do. Take it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t keep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I can&#8217;t churn, and I won&#8217;t, so there! I&#8217;ve got
all I can do to-day. I should not have let it go, but the
cleaning dragged so; besides, I didn&#8217;t know I was going to
have all these men to-day and I thought I could get it
done. Take it back. I can&#8217;t have the churn around in
the way to-day. I&#8217;ve never let a churning go to waste in
my life, but if this gets too sour it won&#8217;t cost any more
than to have hired a girl to help with the work this week.
Go on, and take it to the cellar and let me alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned her back to show him that the argument
was over, and did not see that he went out without
it, leaving it on the back of the one small kitchen table
she had. The pies she had just finished baking were ready
to be taken from the oven, and when she turned to put
them on the table she was confronted by the cream jar.
The table was not large and she must have room for the
food to be cooked that day, so Elizabeth lifted the heavy
jar from the table and, after the pies were out, brought
the churn. She could not carry it to the cellar again and
there was no other way.</p>
<p>The sour cream refused to yield, and the girl churned
on and on while she watched the dinner cook. The dinner
boiled and bubbled, and the stove was working as actively
in the kitchen as the corn-sheller was doing in the barnyard,
when Nathan set Jack in the doorway and followed
him in. Nathan sniffed appreciatively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Smells pretty good in here,&#8221; he said, and then surveying
the room in surprise added, &#8220;What on earth be you
churnin&#8217; for? Ain&#8217;t you got enough t&#8217; do, child?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth stooped to gather Jack into her arms and
made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as hot as th&#8217; devil in here,&#8221; Nathan said, taking his
coat off. &#8220;Here let me have a turn at that churn. You
ought t&#8217; be in bed. That&#8217;s where Sue&#8217;d put you if she
was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the dasher into his own hand and began a brave
onslaught on the over-sour cream. The butter gave signs
of coming, but would not gather. He churned, and the
sweat of his brow had to be wiped frequently to keep it
from where he would literally have it to eat; it ran down
inside his prickly blue flannel shirt, it stood out on
his hair, hands and arms like dew on the morning
grass, and the old man looked out to the wheezing
corn-sheller and envied the men working in the cool
breeze where life and courage could be sustained while
one laboured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be a woman for fifty dollars a day,&#8221; he
announced with grim conviction. &#8220;It&#8217;d make a devil out
of anybody t&#8217; work in this hell-hole. No wonder you&#8217;re
s&#8217; peeked, child.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>John came back to the house almost immediately after
leaving it to go to work in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to bake more pies, Elizabeth. The men
have been put back by a breakdown. They won&#8217;t be able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
to get through before five or half-past,&#8221; he said, coming
into the kitchen to investigate the larder.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t?&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed, longing for the
rest she had planned to get after the dinner work was
finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s too bad, but it can&#8217;t be helped. Now you
get the oven going and I&#8217;ll come in and help you about
beating the eggs. You&#8217;ll have to make custard pie, I
guess, for there ain&#8217;t enough fruit to make any more.
Hurry, and I&#8217;ll be in in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make any more pies to-day,&#8221; Elizabeth
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to. Men like pies better than anything
you could put on the table. How are you off for meat?
Have you chicken enough left or shall I bring up a
ham?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth faced this second meal with a dread she could
not have expressed; she was so tired that she could scarcely
stand; her back ached, and there was a strange pain pulling
at her vitals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to the supper. Go right on out of here.
I am not going to bake any more pies. You crowded
that churning on me this morning and you&#8217;d make my
work double what it ought to be if I let you help. Go on!&#8221;</p>
<p>John brushed past her and lifted the bread-box.</p>
<p>The fierce heat of the cook stove, the pain in her back,
the certain knowledge of suggestions to come, broke down
the poise the girl was trying to maintain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any remarks about that bread-box!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
I&#8217;ve got sense enough to get supper. Go on out to your
own work and let me attend to mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter stepped back in astonishment. He had
been sympathetic, and had really wanted to be helpful.
He was insulted and struck an attitude intended to convey
the fact, but his wife closed the oven door with a bang
and left the room without looking at him.</p>
<p>John punished his wife that night by letting her wash
the supper dishes alone.</p>
<p>The next morning John continued to be aloof of manner
and went to his work without attempting to empty
the skimmed milk as usual, or to strain the new milk
which stood at the top of the long cellar stairs. Elizabeth
skimmed and strained and put the shelves in order. Her
head ached, and her back never ceased hurting. When
the last crock had been carried from the cave, the half-sick
girl dragged herself to the bedroom and threw herself
down on the unmade bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care&mdash;I won&#8217;t do another stroke till I feel
better, if it&#8217;s never done. It wasn&#8217;t nice for me to scold
yesterday when he really wanted to help, but he makes so
much extra work that I <i>can&#8217;t</i> get it all done. It don&#8217;t hurt
him any more to be scolded than it does me to be kept on
my feet after everything in my body is pulling out. He
won&#8217;t run off again and leave me to carry that heavy milk.
I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t just leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not realize that she had done more than
waste useful strength on useless tasks. She had yet to
find out that it would have been cheaper to have left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
entire contents of the cellar to sour or mould than to
have worked on after she could do no more in comfort.
It took Doctor Morgan to point out to her that farmers
and their wives place undue value on a dollar&#8217;s worth of
milk, and that they support those of his profession at a
far greater price than their butter would cost if they fed
the milk to the pigs; also that they fill the asylums with
victims and give younger women the chance to spend
what they have worked to save after they are transplanted
to other regions. They had been obliged to send
for the doctor at noon.</p>
<p>The name of peritonitis did not impress the young wife
with any importance when the old doctor warned her to
lie still and rest. The fierce pain was eased by getting
off her feet and she was so glad to rest that she took his
advice, but she had had no illness and little experience
with chronic ailments. He hoped to pull her through
without the threatened disaster, but warned her solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we have you where you can&#8217;t carry anything
more out of that confounded hole in the ground,&#8221; he
said savagely. &#8220;You&#8217;d never quit till you were down,
anyhow. Now don&#8217;t you lift that child, no matter
whether he cries or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took John aside and talked to him seriously about
his wife, and demanded that there be a hired girl procured.
John listened as seriously and went to the kitchen and got
the supper and prepared for breakfast. He worked diligently
and took Elizabeth a dainty bite to eat, but when
the question of a girl came up, he had his own say about that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the work in this house till you can get around
yourself, but I never intend to look for a girl in this country
again. You&#8217;ll be stronger after a bit and then you can
look for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put Jack&#8217;s nightgown over his little head and buttoned
it in the back while he talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8217;ll pass over, and You&#8217;ll be better in a week&#8217;s time.
I don&#8217;t care if you have two girls, so I don&#8217;t have to hunt
them. Here, Jack, let me slip that shoe off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to get well, though, with the drag of the
housework on my mind,&#8221; the girl said drearily.</p>
<p>Elizabeth wanted a woman in the kitchen. She lay
without speaking for a moment, thinking that as usual she
was unable to get the thing that her own judgment demanded.
John would wash his dishes clean and keep the
cooking and sweeping done as well as she, but she knew
that the first day she would be out of bed she would be
dragged to the kitchen to consult and oversee continually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Morgan said I might not be able to get around
much all summer,&#8221; she ventured, exaggerating the words
of the old doctor somewhat in her determination to get
help at all costs that would leave her free to get well.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least you can wait and see,&#8221; John replied indifferently,
already concerned with his own problems.
He pushed Jack from his lap and sat lost in thought.</p>
<p>Elizabeth made it a rule never to argue unless there was
hope of righting things. To say one word more was to
lose her temper and that she tried not to do. The girl was
really very ill; her head ached, and her body was sore and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
tender. She had not had a whole night&#8217;s sleep for weeks
and every nerve in her body cried out for rest; she wanted
the light put out, she wanted to get quiet and to forget the
house, and to be freed from the confusion; she was so
nervous that she started at every noise. The night was
cool and Jack, who shivered in his thin gown, crawled into
his father&#8217;s lap. John wanted to think at that moment,
and to get rid of him put him firmly down on the foot of
the bed, moving over to give him room at his side as he did
so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t shake the bed!&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed, with
such concentrated irritation that John set the child on the
floor hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only thought you could watch him a minute. I can&#8217;t
keep him on my lap all the time,&#8221; John replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, put him in the bed then, or tie him up or do
something. I don&#8217;t want to watch him, and his climbing
around on the bed sets me crazy!&#8221; she exclaimed, pushing
the child away from her pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t tie children up in the Hunter family,&#8221; John
replied, as usual falling upon the unimportant phase of the
discussion and, instead of putting the child in bed, carried
him off to the sitting room, where he fell into another
brown study and let the baby slip from his lap again.</p>
<p>Jack, as soon as released, ran back to the bedroom and
threw himself up against the side of the bed, stretching his
arms up to be taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, dear; go to papa,&#8221; Elizabeth said, trying to
reach him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span></p>
<p>Jack sidled away toward the foot of the bed, where he
regarded his mother with stolid eyes, and beat a tattoo on
the bed-rail with his hard little head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack! Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; she commanded sharply.</p>
<p>It was torture for her to have the bed jarred.</p>
<p>Jack, baby fashion, raised his head and gave the bed-rail
another whack.</p>
<p>Elizabeth sat up suddenly and gave the child such a
resounding slap that he sat down, shaking the whole house
with the impact, his screams quite in keeping with the
occasion. John carried the crying child out of the
room, shutting the door with such a bang that the house
and bed shook anew, and the girl had to bite her lip to
keep from screaming.</p>
<p>It was the first time Elizabeth had ever struck her child
in anger. Usually gentle and patient with his baby wilfulness,
her heart recoiled at the deed. She knew that the
possibilities of that action had been growing upon her of
late. Nothing could excuse it to the accusing judge of
Elizabeth&#8217;s own soul. It was as if she were fenced around
with a thousand devils; turn where she would there was no
help and but little hope. She had come to understand
herself enough to know that with sufficient provocation
she would almost certainly do it again. The girl thought
of her father. The deed was so like things that she had
seen him do that she almost tore her hair as she prayed to
be spared such a soul-destroying fate.</p>
<p>It was Jack&#8217;s future estimates of her that caused her so
much distress. The things emphasized by the mother in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
a home, she knew, were the things emphasized in the lives
of her children. She had only to look at Jack&#8217;s father to
see the evidences of that truth. Mrs. Hunter&#8217;s cleanliness
and order, her tendency to over-emphasize details,
were her son&#8217;s strongest watchwords. It was absolutely
imperative that she do the right thing by Jack. As she
pondered she decided that she would rise up and make one
more effort for the child. Then, like a creeping serpent,
the thought of her attitude toward the child of her body
suddenly presented its forked tongue and demanded that
its future be reckoned with. From what principle was
she dealing with it? Elizabeth knelt before the shrine of
that child, not in joy and adoration, but with a fear which
had almost become a hatred.</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not realize that it was the work and worry
which she had gone through in these last weeks which
made her irritable. She did not recognize the difference
between nerves and temper, but she had come to understand
that the unborn child was draining her strength.
The prayer in her heart as she lay there thinking it out was
for help to adjust her life to the conditions which she must
meet, for strength to control herself, and for the power to
so order her mental attitude toward this new child that
she might be able to love it as it certainly deserved to be
loved. But even as she prayed a horrible thought took
possession of her:</p>
<p>&#8220;If only it would die and be prematurely released, as
Doctor Morgan had said there was danger of it doing!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then that Elizabeth Hunter realized the possibilities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
in herself. That was murder! If John complicated
her work throughout eternity it would not warrant such
an attitude. But this second child! It was the absorbing
topic of her thoughts as she vainly tried to rest. She
was so worn out that she could face no more work than
she already had to do, and ever as she thought this serpent
of temptation thrust its head out at her and said: &#8220;If the
child would only die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had only to get out of bed and go to work to
rid herself of the hateful burden in the present state of her
health, but under no circumstances would she have done
it. She would have parted with her right hand before she
would have helped to destroy a life she had permitted to
spring into being, and yet&mdash;&mdash; The thought occurred,
and recurred, in spite of every effort, &#8220;If only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And
she knew that if it happened without her assistance
she would be glad.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s distress increased, and when John brought
her dinner on a tray covered with a fresh napkin and
beside the plate a violet he and Jack had found in the
pasture she brightened with pleasure at the dainty arrangement,
but did not touch the food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now be good to the baby; he&#8217;s been asking for you all
morning,&#8221; he said, kissing Elizabeth with an effort at
kindliness and understanding.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s head was aching wildly, and she was so
nervous that she could scarcely endure being spoken to at
all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t leave him here, John, for I can&#8217;t bear to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
have him fussing around,&#8221; she said, trying to be appreciative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, if you don&#8217;t want him at all, I&#8217;ll take him out
again,&#8221; he said crossly, setting the tray on a chair beside
the bed.</p>
<p>He was able, however, to see that the girl was not altogether
herself, and shut the door behind him carefully.
The door shut so softly that the latch did not catch.
When Jack finished his dinner he came running to his
mother&#8217;s room at once. The door gave way under his
hand and he stood looking into the room curiously.
After a glance around, he advanced confidently toward
the bed with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth set her teeth hard. She was unable to reach
out and lift him to a chair where he would not jar the bed,
so it was her intention to be patient.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s eyes fell upon the tray as he passed it, and he
wheeled around and took stock of the contents of this new
form of table. Frantic with irritability and knowing that
she would be at fault in the manner of correcting the child,
his mother let him eat out of the plate she had left untouched,
rather than have a scene with him. Presently,
however, Jack laid down the spoon with which he had
been eating and attacked a dish of berries with his hands,
letting the drops from the ends of his fingers trickle down
the front of his clean gingham dress. Elizabeth happened
to look up and saw what he was doing. There was no
telling when she could get another washing done and her
impulse was to spring at him and snatch him from harm&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
way, but she was trying to be more gentle and, drawing in
a deep breath, she spoke as quietly as she could command
herself to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, Jack,&#8221; she said, reaching out her hand
to take him by the arm.</p>
<p>Jack clutched the dish in sudden haste and raised it to
his mouth, letting a stream of the purple juice dribble from
it to his own bulging front before his mother could get
her hand on him. Then, fearing a repetition of the blow
of the night before, the baby threw himself on the floor,
screaming loudly.</p>
<p>John came excitedly from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done to him now?&#8221; he asked, and
without waiting to hear her reply went out, flinging the
door back with a crash.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark when Doctor Morgan came, but
although he was anxious to get back to his office he saw
at once that he must stay with the suffering girl.</p>
<p>In the morning he called John out to the buggy and had
a little talk with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel, Hunter, as if I&#8217;d been a little to blame for this
thing,&#8221; he said as he picked up his lines to start for home.
&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be able to see that noise and worry were
bad for her. I ought to have impressed the gravity of her
condition on you and warned you that she must not be
worried by that baby. You can see every muscle in her
set hard when the bed is jarred. That child&#8217;s got to be
kept out of there. Those things hurt a woman in that
condition like a knife.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been awfully cross and cried about everything
this week, but she hasn&#8217;t complained much&mdash;that is, of
anything but a little backache,&#8221; John replied, fingering
the whipstock of the doctor&#8217;s buggy and not able to connect
the present serious illness with any real reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little backache!&#8221; Doctor Morgan exclaimed with exasperation.
&#8220;I never seem to be able to get you men to
understand that noise hurts a woman sometimes worse
than if you&#8217;d hit her with a ball-bat. Hurts, mind! It
ain&#8217;t imagination; it hurts, and will send a fever up in no
time. Have I made it clear to you?&#8221; he asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you have,&#8221; John said, relinquishing the whipstock.
&#8220;She&#8217;s been awfully fretful, but I never thought
of her being sick enough for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the old doctor said emphatically. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
lost the child, and You&#8217;ll lose your wife if you don&#8217;t look
out. You get a girl in that kitchen, and see to it that she
tends things without Mrs. Hunter having to look after
her. She won&#8217;t do another day&#8217;s work for a good long
time&mdash;and mind, I say, You&#8217;ll lose her yet if you don&#8217;t
keep that child off her till she has a chance to get well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Doctor Morgan drove away he said meditatively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I got him that time. Blamed fool!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HER WAGES, FOOD AND CLOTHING SHE MUST ACCEPT&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Luther Hansen was at the door when John
returned, and they entered the sitting room
together. Jack was leaning against the bedroom
door, and John, who remembered Doctor Morgan&#8217;s
parting advice, went to close it. The baby ran to his
mother, escaping the outstretched hands of the father,
who was after him, but the child had miscalculated the
opposition this time and was taken firmly into John&#8217;s
arms and lifted free from the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Luther to come to me,&#8221; Elizabeth whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Morgan said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; John began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Luther to come to me,&#8221; Elizabeth repeated, putting
every particle of strength she had into her voice so
that by having Luther hear her John would be obliged
to comply.</p>
<p>Luther came without having to be told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther, could you get Hepsie back for me, if you told
her Mother Hunter was gone and would not come back?&#8221;
she asked, falling back into a whisper from sheer weakness.</p>
<p>Luther bent to catch her words. Elizabeth&#8217;s illness
showed plainly in her pinched face this morning; he would
have done anything she asked of him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he answered cheerfully.</p>
<p>Luther really did not know whether Hepsie could be
had, but he meant to have her if she was not already at
work somewhere else. He listened to the directions and
promised without equivocation that Hepsie would come.
He understood that for some reason the thing Elizabeth
asked of him she could ask of him alone, but was careful
to couch his replies so that that fact was not indicated
even to her.</p>
<p>When it was arranged, Elizabeth closed her weary eyes
as a sign that she wished to be alone, and the men retired
from the room, leaving her in the first real peace she had
known since her illness began. With Hepsie in the house,
she could look forward to the days to come with less dismay.
She resolved that if she did get the girl back that
she would keep her as long as there were hired men to cook
for. With the assurance that Hugh would keep John
from falling into debt again there would be funds to pay
her and there was as much need of a girl in the kitchen as
of men in the field.</p>
<p>Hepsie came gladly. She had always liked Elizabeth,
and the well-furnished Hunter house, with the equally
well-furnished pantry, was desirable.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s life was in grave danger and when John at
last grasped the fact he looked after her needs rigorously.
He tiptoed about the house, looking to it personally that
no discomfort assailed the wan patient. Jack learned the
note of authority in his father&#8217;s voice, and incidentally the
weight of his hand also, and quiet prevailed. John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
reflected the mood of the sick room in every step he took.
Much of the time Elizabeth was too ill to observe John&#8217;s
changed attitude, but the second week she began to awake
to things about her. She went over the situation again
and again. Something had to be done. Things had
promised to straighten out since Hugh&#8217;s coming, but the
very day of his first absence the old coercion was renewed.
John would not have brought the cream jar up without
asking if Hugh had been there, or if he had done so she
could have mentioned the inconvenience of its presence
before Hugh and got it carried back to the cellar. The
importance of Hugh&#8217;s presence loomed up before Elizabeth
as she lay considering her situation; Hugh was her
only hope for better conditions. She had accepted Hugh
as a happy feature of the family life and of the business,
but she had not thought of him as a factor in her personal
affairs.</p>
<p>There was another feature of the weariness which came
from being pushed beyond the amount of work she was
momentarily able to do: she became irritable with Jack
when tired, and then John interfered. Here again, her
only hope lay in Hugh. With Hugh present John was
suave, polite, and apt to treat her as a man is supposed to
treat his wife. Considering all these things, Elizabeth
began to look forward to Hugh&#8217;s return eagerly.</p>
<p>As if to favour Elizabeth&#8217;s plans, Hugh Noland found
Mitchell County a lonely place to stay and as soon as the
fencing was finished put a man in charge and returned
with all possible speed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, John, you brother!&#8221; he exclaimed when he met
John Hunter at the kitchen door the day he arrived. He
held out both his hands. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had such a sense of
coming <i>home</i> since my mother&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
<p>They greeted, and looked at each other long and earnestly,
and John Hunter allowed himself to enter into
closer relations of friendship and love than he had ever
done in the twenty-seven years of his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here,&#8221; John said when he had recovered
from his surprise over this unusual demonstration
of affection. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to lift Elizabeth out into a
chair for the first time to-day. She&#8217;ll be glad you&#8217;ve come
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is she? You didn&#8217;t say much about her in your
last letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t much to say,&#8221; John replied. &#8220;She&#8217;s better&mdash;that&#8217;s
the main thing. Come on into the sitting-room till
I can get her ready and get a quilt in the rocking chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a girl, I see!&#8221; Hugh remarked in a whisper as they
closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and a good one fortunately. Too much milk and
butter. I found that out when I got at it. No more
buttermaking in mine. I had the whole thing on my
hands for over a week. I turned half those cows out to
grass,&#8221; John said, bringing forward the chair for the
invalid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid the morning I left that she had too much
to do with all those shellers on such short notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh stooped to pick up the baby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, partner?&#8221; he cried, swinging the delighted
child up to the ceiling. Jack was wild with joy.
Hugh stood with legs wide apart and cuddled the baby to
him for a squeeze. This was part of the homecoming too.
He was still hugging Jack tenderly when John beckoned
from the bedroom door.</p>
<p>Hugh drew the rocking chair into the bedroom and
then stopped to stare at the wasted figure wrapped in a
quilt who had to be supported while he adjusted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;John! You didn&#8217;t tell me she was like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the thin hands in his, both of them, just as he
had done John&#8217;s a moment before, and was moved almost
to tears by the pallid face. Elizabeth&#8217;s brown eyes had
fallen back into her bony, sharp-lined head, and her nose
was thin and drawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Words fail me, Mrs. Hunter,&#8221; he said feelingly.</p>
<p>But though words failed to express Hugh Noland&#8217;s
sympathy his eyes did not, and the girl, who had not had
an hour&#8217;s sympathetic companionship since he had been
gone, caught the fact and was cheered by it.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland was vital and invigorating. Elizabeth
listened to his account of the adventures in Mitchell
County. He was a good story-teller and his incidents
were well selected. She was too weak to sit up a whole
hour and was carried tenderly back to her bed, where the
family life centred now that she was becoming able to
stand the noise and confusion of it.</p>
<p>During the days which followed, Hugh, at John&#8217;s suggestion,
brought his books and read aloud to them in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span>
little bedroom in the warm spring evenings, and life in the
Hunter house took on a brighter complexion than it had
ever before assumed.</p>
<p>John, who had been sleeping in Hugh&#8217;s room since
Elizabeth&#8217;s serious illness, returned to his own bed. He
looked about him for Jack the first night and asked where
he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent him up to Hepsie&#8217;s room,&#8221; Elizabeth said
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The children in the Hunter family are not put into
the servants&#8217; beds,&#8221; John Hunter replied. The unexplained
statement was offensive to a man accustomed to
being consulted.</p>
<p>To punish her John went to sleep without giving her the
usual good-night kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have been cross, anyhow,&#8221; was all the thought
she gave that part of the circumstance. Could John
Hunter have known that the absence of that kiss was a
relief, and that he made of his presence sometimes an
intolerable nightmare, he might have saved for himself a
corner in her tired heart against the days to come. John&#8217;s
zeal and passion had gone into the pursuit of their courtship
days. Now they were married, possession was a fact:
Elizabeth was his wife.</p>
<p>Elizabeth understood that John was whimsical and
tyrannical, but not intentionally evil, but in spite of the
fact that she had John&#8217;s character summed up and understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425' name='page_425'></a>425</span>
that much that he did was not deliberately intended
to do her injury, that little of it was in fact, she felt a
growing disinclination for his presence. The unloved,
undesired child which she had lost was a warning guidepost
pointing its finger away from a continuance of
marital relations. No conditions could make it right for
her to have another child till love again existed between
them. She saw that nothing could excuse or make decent
the child of wornout conditions; nothing but affection
made marriage worthy, and when that affection had
departed from a man and woman, to thrust life upon a
child was a crime against that child, a crime against nature
and a crime against themselves and society; yet, what
could she do? Her health was broken, and she without
means of support. After Aunt Susan&#8217;s death the girl had
seriously considered separation; she still considered it, but
not seriously. Though she cried &#8220;Fool! fool!&#8221; many
times, she had given her youth, her health, her strength
to John Hunter, and her wages&mdash;food and clothing&mdash;she
must accept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE CREAM-JARS OF HER LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>While Elizabeth progressed toward health the
work on the Hunter farm progressed also. Because
of taking the cattle to Mitchell County it
was possible to get in a greater acreage of small grain and
corn. Patsie had a small colt at her side, as did her mate
also, and there was an extra man needed in the field most
of the time, but after repeated consultations it was
decided that by using care the teams they had would be
able to plow the corn, and that they could hire help for the
harvesting cheaper than they could buy another pair of
horses.</p>
<p>However, in spite of the discussions which were supposed
to have settled the matter, John came home from
Colebyville one Saturday with a new team.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of them?&#8221; he asked Hugh,
who opened the gate to let him into the barnyard.
&#8220;I just made up my mind that it wasn&#8217;t economy
to push the horses we had so hard. I got them at a
bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve bought them, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the brief answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take them back,&#8221; Hugh said slowly but decidedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_427' name='page_427'></a>427</span>
&#8220;Horses and dogs talk with their tails, and I don&#8217;t like the
way this one acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take them back. I got them from a mover. I
got them for a song, and we&#8217;re going to need them for the
binder. I know what we said,&#8221; he went on, interrupting
Hugh, who was trying to speak, &#8220;but there was a bargain
in them and we do need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t the money! How did you buy them?
You couldn&#8217;t pay for them outright.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh Noland had been feeling his way down the foreleg
of the horse nearest him. The animal was nervous and
had crowded over against its mate in an endeavour to get
away. Both its ears were laid back, and there was a half-threatening
air about its movements. As Hugh straightened
up to continue the discussion of finances, it jumped
aside, quivering with fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave a check on the bank,&#8221; John replied uneasily.
Hugh had never criticised him before.</p>
<p>Hugh was taken up with soothing the nervous animal
for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll run out of money before the summer&#8217;s over,&#8221;
he said warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve had to borrow a little already. With
Elizabeth&#8217;s illness and all, I saw we weren&#8217;t going to get
through, so I just took out a loan of five hundred and paid
Doc Morgan while I was at it. I meant to have told you.
I&#8217;ve got some calves coming from over west to-morrow
too.&#8221; John poured it all out while he was at it, with a
relief in having it over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span></p>
<p>There was a pause. When Hugh Noland again spoke
it was with a distinct note of firmness and almost of
authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plain understanding in our partnership&mdash;the one
I laid the most stress upon to start with&mdash;was that there
should be no debts. I&#8217;m willing that you should be free
to select a team; it isn&#8217;t that. Did you borrow this money
in the firm&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes-s-s. I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d care about a little sum
like that,&#8221; John said slowly. He was very uncomfortable.
&#8220;I turned my personal note in on the account book for the
doctor&#8217;s bill. You can see it on the book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt at all but that you did, John. You&#8217;re
not called into question, old boy, on any other matter than
the one of debts, but You&#8217;ll never put this firm five cents in
debt without coming to an instant understanding. I came
to this country to get well. I won&#8217;t get well, but I won&#8217;t
allow myself to get into anything that will run me down
quicker with worry. You knew it before you went in with
me&mdash;and you agreed.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the final word John Hunter felt as he tied the
skittish brute he had just purchased in the stall beside the
door, and turned to put the hay down from the loft above.
The sound of plunging feet and snorts of wild terror when
the hay fell into the manger turned his mind to the probable
truth of Hugh&#8217;s opinion of the lately purchased horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if the blamed brutes are going to be too
maggoty for our use after all,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;It&#8217;d be just
my luck. He was fair about it though,&#8221; John admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
reluctantly. &#8220;Oh, well, after all, he&#8217;s worth having
around, and I&#8217;m going to do a deal better than I would if
he hadn&#8217;t come along. Elizabeth was right&mdash;I did get
in too deep.&#8221; And with this astonishing admission, John
Hunter finished haying the horses and walked slowly to
the house, thinking about the new horses, and half prepared
to admit that he had made a mistake in buying
them outright from a man who was able to get away before
they could be proven, but Elizabeth and Hugh were
already sitting by the table in the living room and he
knew he was wanted. He went to the bedroom to wash
his hands&mdash;John could not form the habit of washing in
the kitchen as other farmers did&mdash;and as he washed,
meditated, and as he meditated he found himself ready
to accept this reproof from Hugh Noland, ready to live up
to agreements if Hugh imposed them, ready to listen to
Hugh and love him. Something in Hugh Noland was so
fundamentally square that the principle of squareness
took on a new meaning to John Hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are! You&#8217;re the one that&#8217;s insisted on these
readings most, and you&#8217;re always late,&#8221; Hugh cried as
John came from the bedroom, fresh and well groomed as if
he had not done barn chores a few minutes before.</p>
<p>The reading was part of John Hunter&#8217;s play world.
John was not a man of scholarly tastes, but reading, like
the use of the hairbrush he had just laid down, was good
form: they were both part of the world to which John
wished to belong. A book might or might not relate to
that world, but it was a book and seemed to do so, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span>
while John Hunter might or might not get much intellectual
advancement out of a book, he got advancement
out of sitting in Hugh Noland&#8217;s presence and opening his
heart to the love and respect Hugh commanded from him.
John did not close himself off from Hugh&#8217;s influence as he
did from Elizabeth&#8217;s, and the things he refused to take
from her he adopted and readily set into action at Hugh&#8217;s
suggestion.</p>
<p>It was destined to be the last night in which John was to
be permitted the comfort of this new feature of home life,
however. As they were gathered about the breakfast
table a man rode into the lane and called John Hunter to
the door without getting off his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doc Morgan was goin&#8217; past my house this mornin&#8217; an&#8217;
asked me if I&#8217;d bring this over t&#8217; you. &#8217;E said it came
after you left town, an&#8217; th&#8217; agent didn&#8217;t know how t&#8217; git
over t&#8217; you &#8217;thout he was comin&#8217; this way this mornin&#8217;.
Hope it ain&#8217;t no bad news.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited to see John tear open the envelope and read
the telegram.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s sick,&#8221; was John&#8217;s hurried statement as
he turned toward the house.</p>
<p>Hugh drove John Hunter to the station. The sun was
hot and he had read till nearly midnight the night before,
and, busy season though it was, he thought it best not to
start home till toward night. Doctor Morgan had returned
home and Hugh, as was his custom, went to the
office for a chat. It was one of the chief delights of both
to have an hour together.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do they get along well together&mdash;Hunter and his
wife?&#8221; Doctor Morgan asked after he had taken Hugh&#8217;s
health into account.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think so if you&#8217;d heard the directions I received
for her care just now,&#8221; Hugh answered with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t make him understand
about her when she was sick. He let that squalling brat
crawl over her, and let her do baking and things she wasn&#8217;t
fit to do till she was worn out,&#8221; the old doctor said resentfully.
Then added as an afterthought, &#8220;Say! You&#8217;re
not letting him run you into debt, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No debts in mine. There&#8217;s one note and It&#8217;ll be
cleared up as soon as the small grain can be disposed of.
I put the clamps on that as soon as I heard of it. It won&#8217;t
happen again. I think his wife was about as glad of the
end of the credit business as any of us,&#8221; Hugh said, and
then added with a laugh: &#8220;I think you&#8217;re mistaken about
his treatment of her, though. You should have heard the
directions he gave me about her as the train was about to
pull out; you&#8217;d have thought she was his favourite child
and that I was going to neglect her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan snorted contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know him. Hunter loves to give directions
to anything from a puppy dog to a preacher. That&#8217;s
what&#8217;s the matter with her. He directs <i>her</i> all the time
as if she didn&#8217;t have sense enough to cook hot water or
wash the baby. He ain&#8217;t any worse than a lot of men I
know of, but you expect more of a man that&#8217;s half-educated.
I tell you, Noland, the trouble &#8217;s in this business of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_432' name='page_432'></a>432</span>
men owning women. I&#8217;ve practised in these parts ever
since this country&#8217;s been opened, and I see a good deal of
husbands&mdash;and they&#8217;re a bad lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh Noland watched the old doctor with a twinkle in
his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to give us men all a knock, are you?&#8221;
he said amusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying anybody&#8217;s bad,&#8221; Doctor Morgan said,
following out his own reasonings. &#8220;The trouble &#8217;s in men
owning everything. Theoretically, a woman shares in the
property, and of course she does if she gets a divorce, but
as long as she lives with him he&#8217;s the one that has the
money and she has to ask for it if she has ever so little.
You take Mrs. Hunter: she don&#8217;t spend a cent he don&#8217;t
oversee and comment on; she&#8217;s dependent on that man
for every bite she eats and for every stitch she wears
and he interferes with every blessed thing she does. Give
that woman some money of her own, Noland, and
where&#8217;d she be? John Hunter &#8217;d treat her as an equal
in a minute; he&#8217;d know she could quit, and he&#8217;d come
to terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan swung the stethoscope with which he
had been listening to Hugh&#8217;s heart, and proceeded without
waiting for Hugh to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we doctors see a side of women&#8217;s lives you other
men don&#8217;t know anything about. We see them suffer,
and we know that the medicine we give them is all knocked
out by the doings of the men they live with, and we can&#8217;t
raise our hands to stop the thing at the bottom of it all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span>
Why, that woman&#8217;s just lost a child I know she was glad
to lose, and&mdash;oh, don&#8217;t misunderstand me! She never
told me she was glad she lost it, but how in God&#8217;s name
could she be otherwise? She couldn&#8217;t do all he required
of her without it. She had butter to make, and shellers to
cook for, and then the damned fool &#8217;d shove that heavy
baby on her&mdash;and he actually talked to me about her
being cross!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh Noland was beginning to feel that living in a
man&#8217;s house did not constitute a knowledge of him, and
yet there were the things he himself had seen and heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, he&#8217;s looking after her now as if she were a baby
herself,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;He urged me to look after her,
and see that she didn&#8217;t have to lift Jack yet for a while,
and to humour the hired girl for fear they&#8217;d lose her, and
he even insisted that I keep up the reading aloud that
I&#8217;ve been doing for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt that,&#8221; the old doctor said, a bit nettled.
&#8220;He&#8217;s not all bad. He&#8217;s a right good fellow&mdash;that&#8217;s the
very point I&#8217;m trying to make. It&#8217;s because he <i>owns</i> her
and thinks he has a right to run her affairs&mdash;that&#8217;s the
trouble at the bottom of the whole thing. Now that she&#8217;s
sick he&#8217;ll see that she don&#8217;t have to lift the baby. If she
owned herself she could stop lifting the baby before she
got sick; a man can&#8217;t tell when a woman feels like working
and when she don&#8217;t. What I want to say is, that a man
browbeats a woman because she hasn&#8217;t any money and
can&#8217;t help herself. Give a woman a home of her own that
he couldn&#8217;t touch, and then give her an income fit to raise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
her children, and he&#8217;d come into that house and behave, or
he&#8217;d be sent out again, and she wouldn&#8217;t age ten years in
three, nor be dragged down to the hell of nagging to protect
herself against him. I tell you, Noland, Kansas
would be a stronger state right now, and a damned sight
stronger state twenty years from now, if the women owned
and run half of its affairs at least.&#8221; Doctor Morgan
ended quite out of breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, doctor, but I&#8217;ve got to get some
barb wire loaded to take home, and you&#8217;ve preached the
regulation hour and a half,&#8221; Hugh said. He was living
in the Hunter home, and he really loved both John Hunter
and his wife, and honour demanded that he should
not gossip about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, my boy. And I see your point too; I&#8217;ve
no business to talk professional secrets even to you.&#8221; He
laid his arm affectionately across the younger man&#8217;s
shoulder and squared him around so that he could look
into his face. &#8220;This is only a side of life I battle with in
almost every home I go into. I&#8217;m almost glad you can&#8217;t
marry; It&#8217;ll leave you where I can respect you. Think of
a woman having a child she don&#8217;t want! and think of a
man respecting himself afterward! It destroys a woman&#8217;s
body, but the men&mdash;well, it&#8217;s the most damnable, soul-destroying
thing in a man&#8217;s life; he&#8217;s lost and don&#8217;t even
know it. Run along,&#8221; he said after a pause, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll hold
forth for another hour in an unprofessional way. It
makes me swear to see a pretty girl made old before she&#8217;s
twenty-five.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span></p>
<p>But Elizabeth Hunter was not to be an old woman
before she was twenty-five, for Elizabeth had Hepsie in
the kitchen, she had learned to protect herself by refusing
to be oppressed about the work she did do, and the weeks
of rest that followed John&#8217;s going were filled with the
things which rested and restored her. It was not long
till she was as attractive as she had ever been in all the
years of her girlhood. Elizabeth was barely twenty-three,
and there was a good constitution back of her which
rest could set right; she was one of nature&#8217;s favourites to
whom colour and spirits return quickly. Every charm
of person she had was enhanced by her present surroundings,
for the brightness and freedom which came from
John&#8217;s absence were the crowning things needed to complete
her recovery.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland read to Elizabeth nightly, and in the
daytime her comfort was his first thought. The work of
cooking for those shellers had been his work as much as
John&#8217;s, but it had all fallen on her, fallen, according to
Doctor Morgan, at a time when a man shielded even the
mare in his harness from overwork. As he watched the
colour come back to the girl&#8217;s face day by day he recognized
that the miracle was brought about by rest. In the
return of Elizabeth&#8217;s beauty there was a new element
which Hugh Noland saw but did not recognize as new: to
the roundness of girlhood was added the strength and
experience of womanhood, to the mere physical charm of
youth the maturity and poise of the woman who has
fought, if not conquered, self.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span></p>
<p>John had set the example of late hours, and the two
read throughout the long, early summer evenings quite as
much from habit as from inclination. It had been the
established custom of the house for so long that Hepsie
and the hired man accepted it as a matter of course.
The men saw little of it because one of the first things
Hugh had done when he had returned from Mitchell
County had been to partition off a room in the well-built
barn for the accommodation of the men. Jake, who
loved Elizabeth with a dog-like fidelity, came and went
about the house more freely than the rest, and saw the
two seated about the sitting-room lamp, and was as glad
as if he had had a place among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hers, God bless &#8217;er!&#8221; he had said the night after
John&#8217;s departure, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m mighty glad she&#8217;s got it.
She ain&#8217;t had much t&#8217; make &#8217;er glad since I&#8217;ve been around
these diggin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those were evenings never to be forgotten. As Hugh
read, Elizabeth listened with the open-mouthed joy of
girlhood, but the substance of what they read was viewed
from the standpoint of a woman. Hugh found the girl&#8217;s
mind keen and alert. They began to turn to the classics,
and Hugh Noland, whose profession it had been to teach,
was surprised and delighted with the aptitude and viewpoints
of his pupil. Elizabeth pursued literature with
her usual thoroughgoing absorption; the dictionary was
brought out and laid upon the table, and with it she spent
long hours when Hugh was in the field.</p>
<p>The second week in June, Hugh Noland was brought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span>
a sudden stop in the delicious holiday experience by a
remark of Elizabeth&#8217;s. The book had been finished earlier
than was usual for them to stop reading, and it had been
decided that it was too late to begin another that night.
Hugh was not ready to go to bed, and sat watching her as
she straightened up the littered table. A book of poems
they had once read fell open and the girl picked it up and
began to read to herself. In a moment she was literally
engulfed in it, and he watched her deep abstraction in full
sympathy with the mood it represented. Presently she
began to read aloud.</p>
<p>Elizabeth read on and on, and Hugh dropped back into
his chair and listened, studying her as she stood before
him reading so intently that she forgot that she stood.
When the end was reached she dropped the book on the
table with a rapturous indrawn breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew what real happiness was before,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I wonder if they read in heaven?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d have to let us read in our heaven or it wouldn&#8217;t
be heaven,&#8221; Hugh Noland replied.</p>
<p>With the words still in his mouth he realized what he
had said. The serpent had invaded their paradise:
henceforth they would wander outside of its confines.
With a self-conscious flush, he shifted the eyes into which
she was looking, and arose to say good-night.</p>
<p>Although she did not understand it, Elizabeth also
turned hastily away; Hugh Noland&#8217;s embarrassment communicated
itself to her. Her confusion puzzled her.
Glancing at the clock, she saw that it was near midnight;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_438' name='page_438'></a>438</span>
she had read longer than she had thought. In her surprised
consideration of what Hepsie would think if she
should hear Hugh pass her door at that hour, she got the
first burst of light on the subject. Until now she had
gone along night after night reading with Hugh Noland,
absorbed in the books, and without any sort of attitude
toward the man except that of good-fellowship, but now
she stood revealed to herself and was covered with shame.
That Hugh might be in love with her did not occur to
her, but that he knew that she had feelings out of keeping
with her vows of marriage she felt certain, and with her
usual intensity Elizabeth went over the mark in her
shame and contrition.</p>
<p>&#8220;What must he have thought I meant? What must
he think of me as a woman? Worse yet, what must he
think of me as a wife?&#8221; she asked herself, and each question
left her more bitterly humiliated, more self-distrusting,
more unhappy.</p>
<p>They were to learn, however, that three months of continual
association over the books had formed a habit not
easily laid aside. To the habit of intellectual companionship
had been added the joy of close and reciprocated
affection, and the sudden breaking off of this daily communication
left both of them, especially Hugh, in a condition
of almost tragic loneliness, but honest of heart and
true of purpose, both avoided further readings.</p>
<p>The nights were hot now; &#8220;good corn weather,&#8221; Jake
called it, and the time had come to &#8220;lay by&#8221; the early
planting. John&#8217;s absence had retarded the plowing, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_439' name='page_439'></a>439</span>
try as he would the chores kept Hugh late in the morning
and had compelled him to quit early at night. It had not
been his intention to take the place of an active field
worker, but the season had come on so rapidly that the
weeds threatened to get the better of the hired men, and
though it was all to learn over again, Hugh had gone out
with the intention of doing good work and had succeeded,
to Jake&#8217;s astonishment and great admiration. It served
Hugh&#8217;s plans at this point to put in the long hours away
from the house, knowing that otherwise he would fall
back into the old life of the book at once. At first the
heavy cultivator handles absorbed his time and thought,
for it was fifteen years since Hugh Noland had cultivated
corn, but when the work became more mechanical his
mind wandered back to forbidden ground and the days
were harder than any he had ever known.</p>
<p>One frightfully hot day, near the end of the plowing of
the first field, which lay near the house, Hugh found it
necessary to rest the horses frequently. With each period
of rest his thoughts returned to Elizabeth with new force
and longing; his mind worked continually on the reading
matter they had gone over, and constantly he wanted to
elaborate or discuss some subject left unfinished. It was
the devil with which he had to wrestle. Also, she showed
the strain of disappointment when he met her at meals,
and he found himself struggling with Doctor Morgan&#8217;s
observations on her health, her husband, and her happiness.
As far as John was concerned, he thought the old
doctor was mistaken, and be it remembered, Hugh Noland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
had a genuine liking for John Hunter. That liking added
to the seriousness of his situation in John Hunter&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>He mopped his perspiring brow, while little wet lines
showed in the creases of his sleeves and across the back of
his thin summer shirt. The fierce heat parched his mouth
and his whole burning body called for a drink. Tying his
team to a post an hour after noon he vaulted over the
fence and walked to the creek, picking his way down to the
narrow stream. The heat of summer was drying the
brook up rapidly; already there was but a tiny rivulet,
but such as was left curled and trickled between grassy
banks in a manner to attract the eye of a thirsty man.
Hugh knelt on a hummock with his hand on the opposite
bank and drank as only the man who plows corn on a hot
June day can. As he stood up he paused with his handkerchief
halfway to his face and listened, while the water
dripped from nose and chin unheeded. The continuous
tones of a voice reading aloud reached him. It was such
a curious place to encounter such a phenomenon that he
listened intently for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth!&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>Every pulse in Hugh Noland&#8217;s body pounded suddenly.
On the first impulse he was away in her direction, walking
rapidly and without effort at concealment. Without taking
time to think, without knowing or caring whether it
were wise, he walked as straight toward the spot as the
laden bee to the hive.</p>
<p>Hugh&#8217;s coming fell upon Elizabeth suddenly, but the
perfect naturalness of her joy put him at his ease.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you reading,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;What are you
working on now?&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw himself down on the grass beside the willow
trunk on which she was seated and held out his hand for
the book. After running his eye over the page he handed
it back to her with the request that she read on. The heat
of the summer day shimmered along the horizon outside,
but here in the cool shade of the willows the delicious
afternoon air lulled his senses and made of the spot a paradise
of comfort and contentment. The girl was the
embodiment of everything sweet and womanly to him,
and the joy of the moment, bringing added colour to her
cheeks, made the utmost contrast imaginable to the dust
and drudgery of the afternoon in the corn rows.</p>
<p>Hugh&#8217;s coming had been so obviously voluntary and
joyous that the fear she had entertained, that he would
think ill of her as John Hunter&#8217;s wife, was set at rest.
The old confidence, sympathy, and companionship were
retendered, and the girl met it with her habitual openness.
She accepted the book from his hand and read as asked.
Hugh Noland watched her earnestly, and recalled the
things he had been told about her and her affairs. On
more than one occasion he had been told that she had been
neglected, and at the time had put the tale away as foolish
farm gossip, but Doctor Morgan was no fool, and his
gossip was usually not only true but had on this particular
occasion fallen out with vehemence and conviction. As
he looked at her he asked himself how any man could
neglect a woman of Elizabeth&#8217;s sincere qualities. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span>
so true that the only indication that he had ever received
of even a slight difference of opinion with her husband had
been the accidental one regarding debts. He remembered
a remark of Sadie Hansen&#8217;s to the effect that John Hunter
never took his wife anywhere, and he remembered that in
the four months he had been in the house he had never
heard him offer to do so, and then Hugh Noland remembered
that he had no right to think about it at all. However,
his mind recurred to it in spite of all he could do,
and presently he was immersed in the old consideration.
Loyalty must be one of her qualities: four months he had
been in her house and she had never been taken anywhere
except to Nathan&#8217;s, where he himself had taken her, and
she had never remarked upon it, and she was but twenty-three!</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-three!&#8221; he said under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it you said?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he replied guiltily.</p>
<p>Elizabeth became conscious and embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept you all afternoon!&#8221; she exclaimed, getting
suddenly to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to be kept,&#8221; Hugh admitted slowly, rising
also. &#8220;It&#8217;s frightfully hot in the middle of the afternoon.
I&#8217;ll work late, and milk after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring up the cows and do the milking,&#8221; she volunteered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see you!&#8221; he protested, and went to his work
again.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland had never even guessed that he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span>
walk deliberately over and spend a whole afternoon with
a woman he had no right to love after becoming aware
that he was already in love with her. For the first time
he stood in the limelight of strong emotions and knew himself
for what he was, not only that he was a mere man, but
that he was a man who was not showing the proper control
over feelings and emotions which thousands of men and
women alike controlled every day. He worked his problem
over as he worked the mellow soil about the corn
roots and made himself late, but with contradictory impulses
hurried the milking when he did get at it so as to
get down to the book again.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had taken time to think out her side of their
position, and told herself that she hoped that Hugh would
not offer to read to-night, but as the time approached she
trimmed the lamp and arranged the books on the sitting-room
table with a slight sense of worry for fear he would
not come, and conscious that the evening was going fast.
It was late when they began, and correspondingly late
when they finished the reading that night.</p>
<p>The next night Hugh sat on the upturned manure cart
talking to the men till he saw Elizabeth put out the light
in the sitting room, and then, in spite of the fact that he
had been strong enough to stay away, was sorry that he
had not had one more night&#8217;s reading with her before John
came home. John was coming in the morning, and Hugh
was to meet him, and Hugh Noland did not like himself,
nor the position he would be in when he thought of greeting
John Hunter as a friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_444' name='page_444'></a>444</span></p>
<p>The better to think things out and decide what he would
do, Hugh sat down on the doorstep and did not go in.
The night was perfect. There was a full moon and the
soft breeze was a delicious reminder of the coolness of the
leafy bower among the willows where he had spent the
afternoon with Elizabeth. There was to be no more of
Elizabeth for him, God bless her! Elizabeth was a wife
and honour demanded that not even a glance of affection
pass between them. This Hugh Noland believed, and
yet when they were together their little embarrassments
cried their love aloud, and neither could mentally avoid
the issue. Each had known that the other had resolved
and suffered and fallen into the temptation of the reading.
The book was becoming a delicious torment. He could
not stay in that house. Plainly, it was going to be necessary
for him to go away. The business demanded his
attention, and he decided to go to Mitchell County. At
that point Hugh stopped in his calculations to consider
how things would run at this end of the line if he did so.</p>
<p>In summing the business up, Hugh summed up his impression
of John Hunter along with it, and found himself
reluctant to go away and leave everything in his hands.
John was industrious and tidy about his work. Dear old
John! He had come very near Hugh&#8217;s heart in the short
time they had been together. The daily consideration of
possible death had mellowed Hugh Noland&#8217;s naturally
fine nature, and given him the tenderness of attitude and
thought that the sublime and inevitable impose upon those
who live in its shadow. Actions considered as final are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span>
warmer and less likely to be inconsiderate than those where
there is a feeling of indefinite time to correct mistakes.
Hugh sat now and let his heart run out to John with all
the love of a more than usually affectionate nature. In
his heart he wanted John back home, and yet it made him
uneasy. There was a peculiar sense of being a traitor as
he considered the meeting with this man who had trusted
his home in his hands. In regard to the business, he,
Hugh, would have to let things take their own course.
All he had on earth was in this farm now, but he would get
away as soon as he could possibly do so; he would sacrifice
that much to the man whose home he had entered. Hugh
knew to a nicety how necessary it would be for his interests
in a business way to be here on the ground and keep
John Hunter from going into debt. Hugh had his own
judgment, neighbourhood gossip, and Doctor Morgan&#8217;s
plain instructions on that point, but was resolved to go if
he lost all that he had in so doing. &#8220;Well, at any rate, he
can&#8217;t mortgage anything without consulting me, and I&#8217;ll
get as much of the stock out there as I can after next
year&mdash;that is, if there is any next year for me,&#8221; he said,
as he got up to go to bed long after midnight.</p>
<p>The morning of John&#8217;s return Elizabeth asked Hugh
to take her as far as Nathan&#8217;s on his way in to town.
Hugh had not sat on the step till midnight the night before
to let himself fall into temptation the first thing in the
morning, and suggested that since the shafts of the buggy
were mended that she drive over to Nathan&#8217;s alone, giving
as his reason that he might be unable to come back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
promptly. The girl fell into his plan so readily that
Hugh in his contradictory frame of mind wondered about
it and was half hurt. As he hitched Patsie into the shafts,
however, he reasoned it out that Elizabeth Hunter was
probably making the same fight that he was making. He
tied the mare in the side lane and left her there without
going to the house as usual to help with Jack. If she were
fighting for her own esteem, as he was doing, Hugh resolved
not to be the cause of temptation; it made him feel
a little better about meeting John. Could he have known,
as Elizabeth did, that it was the first time since her marriage
that she had had the privilege of driving alone
and that the precedent once established would settle the
possibility of demanding a horse whenever she wanted it,
it would have put a different complexion on the matter.</p>
<p>In order for Elizabeth to use the buggy, however, Hugh
was obliged to drive the strange team. Jake had been
using them since John&#8217;s absence, but had come in from the
field the night before with the announcement that he did
not intend &#8220;to risk his neck with them broncos any
more.&#8221; Before Hugh got to Colebyville he was thoroughly
displeased with them, and spoke of his dislike of
them to John on the way home.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few days on the harvester &#8217;ll fix them,&#8221; John
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re acting better than they did on the way
in. They&#8217;re hot and tired, and maybe the harvester will
do it, but they&#8217;re a bad lot,&#8221; Hugh replied wearily. &#8220;I
feel that I&#8217;ve got to get away to Mitchell County. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span>
cattle have been on my mind for days. You&#8217;ll have
this team on your hands, for none of the men but Jake
would try to use them, and he told me last night he&#8217;d used
them for the last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well, Hugh?&#8221; John Hunter asked with
such concern that Hugh was covered with humiliation and
shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes-s-s. But you can run the place and I&#8217;m not
hanging out like I thought I could&mdash;and I like it down
there; it&#8217;s more like the life I&#8217;ve been ordered to lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till the rye has been cut. Did you say Silas
wanted us to cut his too?&#8221; John Hunter asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He stopped me as I drove over this morning.
The boys will lay the early corn by to-day; we can get the
binder out to-morrow and see that it is ready by the day
after. We might have been through with the corn to-day,
but I&#8217;ve been lazy of late. I knocked off and rested and
read most of the hot part of yesterday afternoon,&#8221; Hugh
replied slowly. He wished in his heart that he could tell
all.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the thing to do. I&#8217;m not going to have you
going down to Mitchell County while it&#8217;s so hot. You&#8217;ll
lay around the house and read, that&#8217;s what You&#8217;ll do, and
I&#8217;ll run this farm for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought of that took Hugh Noland&#8217;s breath. That
was what he was running away from, but he could think of
no reason but his health, and dropped the subject to get
away from it.</p>
<p>John Hunter asked questions about every feature of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_448' name='page_448'></a>448</span>
farm work, and as he asked watched Hugh&#8217;s face, looking
anxiously for signs of breaking health. Under no conditions
would he let Hugh get sick. Hugh had been the
happiest circumstance of this farming experience. There
was a discouraged note in Hugh&#8217;s voice that John did not
like.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Morgan to-day?&#8221; he asked after he had
had all the farm work explained to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now, don&#8217;t you get to worrying because I happen
to mention my health. Yes, I saw Morgan, and he
agreed with me that the other place would be better for
me. I can run that and you can run this, and with care
we ought to make some money pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that takes you away from us and&mdash;and we want
you here!&#8221; John exclaimed with such fervour that Hugh
winced under it.</p>
<p>Hugh smiled so sadly back at the eager, boyish face
turned to his that John was more than ever sure he was
ill. His hand shot out to him with an almost womanish
sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see to it that you&#8217;re kept busy where you belong,
and the work won&#8217;t wear you out either, my boy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hugh saw that he was getting deeper in at every word
he uttered and went back to a discussion of the farm
work.</p>
<p>Elizabeth waited intentionally till she saw the men pass
Nathan&#8217;s house before she started home. Try as she
would, she did not yearn for her husband&#8217;s return. Life
was short, her youth was going fast, and her fear of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_449' name='page_449'></a>449</span>
faded life grew as she looked forward to an old age spent
with John Hunter after Hugh&#8217;s departure. Hugh must
go, there was no question about that. He had told her
night before last that he thought of it; had spoken of it
incidentally enough, but in such wise that the girl knew
why he was going. She had felt at the time that Hugh
listened for her reply, but there was none she could make,
and her silence added the final word to his decision.
Elizabeth knew that it was the only honourable course;
she consented to it in her mind, and yet, as she looked
ahead to a time when she could not have him to take
shelter behind with the cream jars of her life, she was
sick at what she must face. Even to-day she hoped
that he would be present when she drove Patsie into the
yard.</p>
<p>Fortune favoured Elizabeth in getting home with the
horse and buggy. John had said that he was going to the
pasture to look over the stock, and when Hugh saw
Elizabeth drive through the gate they had left open, there
was nothing for him to do but go forward to take her
horse. John had seen her coming and had come back
from the pasture gate, and the three met.</p>
<p>&#8220;See how brave I have become in your absence,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;ve driven horses as long as I have,&#8221;
John Hunter replied happily, and kissed the astonished
wife and the child in her arms with such real pleasure in
returning to them that it was good to meet him after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;d always be like that,&#8221; Elizabeth thought wistfully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_450' name='page_450'></a>450</span>
and Hugh Noland felt more like a criminal in the
presence of that kiss than he had ever done in his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, I&#8217;ll tie Patsie up after I give her a drink. You
go in with Elizabeth and I&#8217;ll follow as soon as its done,&#8221;
John said to Hugh, and turning to Elizabeth said, &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t taken very good care of him since I&#8217;ve been away,
dear. Go on in and get a book and I&#8217;ll listen for an hour
before I go to the pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do no such thing. I&#8217;ll go to that pasture with you&mdash;that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;m not sick. Rats! Elizabeth
knows I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh Noland stopped short, &#8220;I beg your pardon, Mrs.
Hunter,&#8221; he added confusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you shouldn&#8217;t call me by my first
name; I do you,&#8221; Elizabeth answered, glad in spite of
herself.</p>
<p>Hugh went away with John, and Elizabeth had a long
time to think about it. It was the first time Hugh had
ever dropped into the least familiarity in addressing her,
and no amount of reasoning could keep her from feeling a
thrill of pleasure over it. She did not approve of herself,
but the thrill was there. She hated herself, but the thrill
remained. She wondered bitterly if she would ever be
able to approve of herself again; every turn of life&#8217;s wheel
brought out some new and hitherto unsuspected characteristic,
and try as she would she could not make herself
do as her code of morals demanded that she should. She
thought of her various friends; none of them had ever
been guilty of the things Elizabeth found herself culpable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_451' name='page_451'></a>451</span>
of. Sadie had rebelled against her first child, but when
shown the consequences had cheerfully applied the lesson,
while she, Elizabeth, had been unable to put into practice
later the very precepts she had so glibly given her neighbour.
None of her friends had ever committed the
folly of falling in love with men who were not their
husbands.</p>
<p>Elizabeth would not stay for the reading that night, and
had a bad hour before she fell asleep. Her love for Hugh
looked even worse to her since John&#8217;s arrival than it had
done before. This new phase of her life was even less able
to command respect than any which had preceded it.
Why was she vexed with such unheard of temptations?
It did not comfort her to reason it out that this thing had
fallen upon her without any wish of hers, that the thrill
which had followed his use of her name was not a thing she
had deliberately fostered within herself; she demanded of
herself that she should not thrill at his voice, not knowing
that she demanded the impossible.</p>
<p>The rye was to be cut at Silas Chamberlain&#8217;s. John
suggested to Elizabeth that she had better go over to help
Liza Ann, since she was alone, saying that he would take
her over when he went. Hugh was to go with the machine.
Jake would drive the extra team over, and the
other two men would plow corn at home. A few minutes
before nine o&#8217;clock John announced that he was
ready. He had come in to carry Jack to the buggy
for her. John had gone away with the impressions
of Elizabeth&#8217;s illness still upon him, and looked out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_452' name='page_452'></a>452</span>
for her with the same care he had accorded her when
an invalid.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221; he asked, dropping down on the foot of
the bed beside the machine upon which she had been
putting in the spare time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this one little seam; I&#8217;ll have it done then.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stooped over the machine to finish the seam quickly,
not liking to keep John waiting when he was already somewhat
late.</p>
<p>Jack slipped from his father&#8217;s lap, and fascinated by
the swiftly moving wheel on a level with his face, put out
a pudgy little forefinger to feel of it as it went around.
His mother saw it and stopped short with a little cry of
alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, Jack!&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take
your finger right off of your hand if you get it in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack put his hand behind his little back, and stood in
round-eyed wonder watching the wheel as she started to
sew again.</p>
<p>John was getting restless and wanted to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked up at him as he started to speak, and
Jack&#8217;s finger shot out to the forbidden wheel on the instant.
Elizabeth saw it at a point when she could not
control the pedal with her foot. Mother love brought a
scream to her lips, and to save the child she gave him a
shove with her hand. Jack fell on the floor in a heap,
striking his head on the bedpost as he did so.</p>
<p>John had clutched at him ineffectually as he fell and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_453' name='page_453'></a>453</span>
caught him up as soon as he could get hold of him, turning
him over in his arms to see where he was hurt. The blood
spurted from the little nose, giving an appearance of serious
injury to the matter all out of proportion to the exact
nature of the damage sustained, but as usual, when
excited, John saw only surface indications.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does possess you when you&#8217;re cross?&#8221; he exclaimed
as he relinquished his hold on the baby, who,
however badly he might be hurt, was struggling to get to
his mother&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>Elizabeth carried the screaming child to the kitchen to
bathe the bruised nose and apply a wet cloth to the nasty
blue ridge beginning to form where the little cheek had
encountered the bedpost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw any one act like you do with a child,&#8221;
John said with his usual irritation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend to knock him over, but I couldn&#8217;t stop
my foot and I thought he&#8217;d get his little finger taken right
off before my very eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you shouldn&#8217;t go at him so rough. You always
treat him as if he were a block of wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s lips closed down tight, and to keep Jack
from hearing further criticisms of her management she
went back to the bedroom. When John was ready to go
he called to her from the lane, and she carried Jack to the
door instead of laying him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take Hepsie with you. Tell Mrs. Chamberlain that
I got ready to come. He&#8217;d probably be cross if I went
now. Hepsie&#8217;s in the potato patch,&#8221; Elizabeth said in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_454' name='page_454'></a>454</span>
a low voice, and went back so promptly that John could
not reply.</p>
<p>John took Hepsie with him, and explained to Liza Ann,
as Elizabeth requested, that she was unable to come because
Jack had hurt himself.</p>
<p>The day was dry and hot, and John Hunter consumed
water like a fish upon all occasions. The discovery that
the water-jugs had been left at home called for instant
action when he arrived in the field. Silas had put his
team on the binder and Patsie was free for use on just such
errands as this. The machine had just been driven up to
where Hugh could ask for water also. John crossed over
and laid his hand on the lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you take the horse and go for the water. I forgot
the jugs; You&#8217;ll have to go clear home after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it?&#8221; Hugh asked.</p>
<p>John Hunter looked him over rather sharply and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m going to drive this binder to-day. I
don&#8217;t like your voice very well since I got home, Hugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t hear very much more of it if I can get away
day after to-morrow,&#8221; Hugh replied, smiling at the turn
he had given to John&#8217;s sympathy.</p>
<p>John Hunter grinned back at him, but kept his hand
on the lines, and Hugh got down.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t start day after to-morrow, for we won&#8217;t get
this rye done, and you won&#8217;t start then, my boy, with
such a note in your voice as that. I&#8217;ve spoken to Jake
about it and he&#8217;ll go. I don&#8217;t propose to have you that
far away when you are not well&mdash;it ain&#8217;t what we want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_455' name='page_455'></a>455</span>
you for. Go on and get that water,&#8221; he added when he
saw the expression of protest in Hugh&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Hugh went without argument, but his determination
was as strong as ever. Instead of going around the road
he drove across the field to the fence between the two
places, and, tying Patsie, walked through the cornfield to
the pasture and on toward the house.</p>
<p>The hot sun blazed fiercely down on his thinly clad back,
and he noticed as he struggled through the tasselling corn
that the leaves were already firing about the roots. Rain
was essential, but he reflected that enough rain to do the
corn any good would ruin the small grain now ready to
cut. &#8220;Kansas luck,&#8221; he muttered as he crossed the deep
ridges thrown up by his own cultivator a few days before.
Not a breath of air was stirring, and by the time he had
reached the house he was hot and tired. Reflecting that
John had taken Elizabeth to Chamberlain&#8217;s, he decided
to rest before he started back with the heavy water-jugs.
He stopped in the kitchen for a drink and took a small
bottle out of his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, I guess, this time,&#8221; he said as he poured the
tablets into his hand. He dropped his finger on the other
wrist a moment, and then swallowed both pellets.</p>
<p>Elizabeth heard him settle himself in a rocking chair
with a long-drawn breath of comfort. She was giving
Jack little pats to ease him off to sleep and the house was
very quiet. She decided to keep still and let him return
to the field without seeing her tear-stained face, but Jack
roused with a low whimpering cry which she felt sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_456' name='page_456'></a>456</span>
Hugh must have heard, and as soon as the child was asleep
she walked out without further effort at concealment.</p>
<p>At the noise of the opening door Hugh Noland sprang
to his feet in surprise; he had been half-asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t know that you were here!&#8221; he exclaimed
when he saw that it was Elizabeth. &#8220;I thought you went
to Chamberlain&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes riveted themselves upon her swollen eyelids,
and when she stood embarrassed before him and did not
reply readily, conscious only of his searching gaze, he
misunderstood and added gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth, there is something I must speak about. I
cannot have you worried over matters between us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s eyes ceased to be shy and troubled
and came up to his in such complete astonishment that he
broke off in confusion.</p>
<p>There was a pause for one short second, and then
Elizabeth spoke in nervous haste, and as if to ward off
something.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I wasn&#8217;t crying about&mdash;that is, I hurt Jack
accidentally and&mdash;and John misunderstood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even while the words were still in her mouth, she realized
by his expression that what she was saying sounded
like a complaint, as if she were exposing a difference
between herself and her husband, and that was the one
thing that under no circumstances had she ever done.
She made a frightened stop without ending the sentence.</p>
<p>As if to save his mother from needless embarrassment,
Jack slipped to the floor and came stumbling out on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_457' name='page_457'></a>457</span>
sleepy legs, tired and cross, and rubbing his sweaty little
face with hot, sweaty little fists, and demanding his
mother&#8217;s attention. Elizabeth turned to him with a relief
beyond words.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland, who had always loved the child, was
never so glad to see him, and slipped away while he was
being soothed and petted out of his tears and discomfort.
Both Hugh and Elizabeth knew that but for Jack&#8217;s timely
interruption words would have escaped Hugh that they
both preferred should not be uttered. Both knew the
situation, but both saw that it would be easier, as well as
safer and more honourable, not to discuss it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not think any more about going away&mdash;I
wouldn&#8217;t do it if I had money,&#8221; she decided as she watched
Hugh return with his jug. &#8220;I married John Hunter in
good faith, and I&#8217;ll live with him in good faith and
straighten things out.&#8221; The thought of her love for
Hugh came up and she added, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care! I didn&#8217;t go
out to hunt up a love for him and I can&#8217;t help it if it has
come to me; but I hope he gets away to Mitchell County
day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>BOUND TO THE STAKE</h3>
</div>

<p>The harvesting dragged out to the third day, and
Silas, who had a felon, could not give help when
John came to the point of cutting his own grain.
It was almost impossible to get help, for the reason that
the dry weather had hastened the reaping of all early
crops. It was decided that Elizabeth should drive back
and forth with the water, and John take a hand at the
shocking. This left Hugh on the machine, a thing John
disliked to do, but Hugh made no complaints and accepted
the post readily. Hugh had seen that he could
not refer to his health without endangering his chance of
getting away. John looked him over critically as he
mounted the binder, realizing fully that he was unfit to
ride in the hot sun all day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take his place this afternoon if the shocking never
gets done,&#8221; was his mental resolve as he turned to his own
share of the work.</p>
<p>The men had taken one jug of water with them, so that
it was not necessary for Elizabeth to go with a fresh one
till ten o&#8217;clock. She tied Patsie to the fence and, taking
Jack with her, crawled under and started across the field
to a point where she could meet the oncoming binder, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_459' name='page_459'></a>459</span>
that Hugh could take the heavy jug on the machine
around to the other side of the field where the shockers
were. Jack&#8217;s short legs had hard work in the stubble, and
she kept a tight hold on him with one hand while she
carried the jug with the other.</p>
<p>Hugh saw them coming and called to her to wait till he
could come for the jug. Doctor Morgan had especially
cautioned against heavy lifting.</p>
<p>The new team which John had bought was hitched to
the pole of the harvester, and as he drew them up, a botfly
buzzed suddenly about the forelegs of the off-wheel
horse. The animal struck at it angrily with its foot, giving
a shrill snort. Its mate threw itself to the other side,
rattling the double-trees of the leaders against their heels.
There was a frightened spring on the part of one of the
horses in front, and at that the wild and half-broken
wheel horses began to plunge ahead.</p>
<p>Thoroughly frightened, the four horses became unmanageable
at once, and the one nearest the revolving reel
got its tail over the line, where it held firmly to it as it
reared and kicked. Almost before it was clear what had
happened, the horses were on a full run down the field,
with a barbed-wire fence ahead. Hugh could do but one
thing. He circled them about toward the outside of the
field by the one line he could control, while he frantically
jammed the lever down, which threw the machine out of
gear, but at the speed at which the machine was going
the lever would not act. The one line swung the horses
around in a short circle, and as the thoroughly alarmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_460' name='page_460'></a>460</span>
man raised his head he was horrified to find that Elizabeth,
encumbered with the jug, and so thoroughly frightened
that she held on to it and to Jack&#8217;s hand with equal tenacity,
was within the radius of the circle.</p>
<p>The baby, the mother, and the heavy water-jug were in
the centre of that narrowing ring, and the natural and
spontaneous thing to do was to run in the direction away
from the careening harvester. They ran, but only for a
few yards, for by the time they thought that they were
nearing a point of safety at the circumference of the circle,
the horses were nearing that point also, and to attempt to
cross it was suicidal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back!&#8221; shouted Hugh, his whole body breaking
into a cold sweat as the woman and child turned to run in
the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Had presence of mind been possible at that moment,
Elizabeth could have slipped quickly behind the binder
and passed outside the ring the charging animals were
making, but as it was, she simply ran blindly back once
more to another and more dangerous point inside their
lessening orbit. One more such run and both mother and
child would be exhausted.</p>
<p>With the cold sweat of terror breaking over him, Hugh
Noland slackened his hold on the line and flung himself
off the high seat to run to her assistance. As he jumped,
the horses of their own accord turned sharper yet, and the
bull-wheel, striking a badger hole, threw the machine
over sidewise and completely upside down. The wheel
horses, released by the coupling-pin falling from the main
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_461' name='page_461'></a>461</span>
clevis, kicked themselves loose from the other team and
tore madly across the uncut grain.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter escaped death by the overturning of
the heavy binder, but when she arrived at the twisted and
broken harvester, Hugh Noland lay pinned under the
wreckage, white and insensible.</p>
<p>It took but a few moments for the men, who had come
running at the first sounds of the commotion, to lift the
heavy machinery from the limp body and lay the wounded
man down under the shade of a large shock of rye. While
Luther bent to examine the senseless form, John rushed
one of the men frantically off for Doctor Morgan.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Wait&mdash;I&#8217;ll go myself!&#8221; he called as the man
was driving away, and flinging himself into the buggy,
which Elizabeth had left at the fence, laid the whip on the
back of the frightened Patsie.</p>
<p>It was not till John was halfway to Colebyville that
Hugh Noland opened his eyes. Luther was stooping over
him, bathing his face with water from the jug which Elizabeth
had so unconsciously provided. The girl also knelt
at his side rendering such assistance as was in her power,
and when Hugh actually showed signs of being alive she
buried her face in her hands and sobbed with an abandon
which Luther Hansen could not mistake. The hired men
had gone to get the leaders, which, being reliable horses,
had got over their fright and were nibbling the fresh grass
by the fence. The other team was completely out of sight.
They covered Hugh from the scorching sun till the
men could bring the wagon from the barn, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_462' name='page_462'></a>462</span>
the sad little cavalcade returned to the house with the
injured man.</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan arrived with John in his own buggy
two hours later, and then a strange thing was discovered.
No bones were broken, and no internal injuries were in
evidence which would necessarily give cause for alarm.
The examination pointed to an excited heart chiefly, the
weakest link in Hugh Noland&#8217;s system and the place where
new troubles centred and aggravated old ones. That the
man&#8217;s life had not been instantaneously crushed out was
due to the fact that the long steel levers had stuck in the
hard earth and held the machine up. But the trouble
with the heart had been accentuated acutely before the
binder had even capsized, for that horrible nightmare of
galloping down upon the girl had evidently begun what
the later catastrophe had carried to a farther and really
dangerous stage.</p>
<p>Hugh was placed in the downstairs bedroom by the
men, whose hearts were wrung at every step they carried
him, and, as Luther remarked, because Elizabeth would
have the care of him and stairs were deadly things in case
of sickness.</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan came again before night, intending to
stay with the patient till morning. John met him at
the gate. With the feeling that he had been responsible
for this terrible accident to Hugh, whom he loved
as he had never loved any other human being, John
had spent an afternoon of agony. The rest of the
men could look for a neighbour to finish the grain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_463' name='page_463'></a>463</span>
with another machine, but for him, he spent the time at
Hugh&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is he?&#8221; Doctor Morgan asked almost before he
was within speaking distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resting. We don&#8217;t trouble him, but he seems
quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good!&#8221; the old man exclaimed. He had come
with his heart in his mouth, as they say in that country.
&#8220;I wish I had as good a report for you,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what&#8217;s happened to me?&#8221; John asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young mare you drove in died in the stable. It&#8217;s
hot weather, and I guess you were pretty badly excited.
I told the men in the livery to shut the colt up; it kept
nosing around the carcass and it isn&#8217;t good for it. You&#8217;d
better get in as early as you can and look after it yourself.
Those stable men don&#8217;t care for anything that ain&#8217;t their
own.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter stood speechless till the end of the story,
and then helped tie the doctor&#8217;s team.</p>
<p>&#8220;That all comes from that miserable team! I&#8217;m glad
one of them did have to be shot. I&#8217;ve half a notion to
shoot the other one; it&#8217;s all cut up by the wire and &#8217;ll take
no end of trouble to cure. Hugh said horses and dogs
talked with their tails, and I guess they do. Say, will
you tell Elizabeth about the horse? It&#8217;s one I got from
her father and she&#8217;s terribly fond of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth met Doctor Morgan as he came from Hugh&#8217;s
room a few minutes later with the unspoken question so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_464' name='page_464'></a>464</span>
plainly evident in her face that he answered it without
waiting to be asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No signs of further trouble, little woman, thank God!
They tell me you were near being run over by that binder
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth evaded the last remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing. But are you sure about Hugh?&#8221; she
asked in a voice that quavered a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here,&#8221; the doctor said, concerned at once
for her welfare. &#8220;We can&#8217;t have you go and get upset.
It looks as if Noland got out of that pretty lucky. The
only thing that&#8217;s worrying me is that infernal heart of
his.&#8221;</p>
<p>John came in at that point and the old doctor addressed
himself to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This woman&#8217;ll have to take care of Noland, Hunter,
and I want you to see to it that she don&#8217;t have another
thing to do. She can&#8217;t have that child dragging on her,
and we&#8217;ll have to look out that she don&#8217;t overdo, or we&#8217;ll
have her down on our hands too. The trouble with peritonitis
is that it don&#8217;t get well as fast as it looks to. A
slight thing will often start it up anew, and peritonitis is
the devil if it gets to recurring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all help take care of Hugh,&#8221; John promised
readily.</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan looked at John Hunter and back to
Elizabeth dubiously. He reflected that the same lack of
caution which had killed the mare yesterday might kill
a man in case of excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_465' name='page_465'></a>465</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessarily help that she&#8217;s going to need. It
won&#8217;t be so hard to take care of him, if she isn&#8217;t worried by
a lot of other things. I don&#8217;t want another soul to touch
that medicine. We&#8217;ve got to be mighty careful about that.
Heart remedies are poison and as quick as lightning in
their action, and we can&#8217;t afford to take any chances
on that kind of stuff. I&#8217;m right glad to put your wife at
the helm in this thing; she&#8217;s definite and dependable, two
things we doctors don&#8217;t often find when we need them
most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to Elizabeth he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be rather hard on you, but our main care is to
pull this man through the next ten days. If he don&#8217;t
have some one to look after him right, he may slip
through our fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I thought you said he was all right,&#8221; Elizabeth
faltered.</p>
<p>In his efforts to impress the need of care with the medicine,
Doctor Morgan had gone over the mark and added
to the fears he had started out to allay. Elizabeth was
as white as if all the blood in her body had been taken
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t begin to worry till I tell you there&#8217;s need,
child,&#8221; he said half irritably. &#8220;All that&#8217;s necessary is for
you to look after that medicine. Noland &#8217;ll come out all
right with you to nurse him. I wouldn&#8217;t mind being sick
myself, Hunter, with her to hold the spoon,&#8221; he said, trying
to put a merry face on the matter. &#8220;Did it ever occur
to you that you were a lucky dog to come into this country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_466' name='page_466'></a>466</span>
and run off with the nicest girl in it the first year you
were here?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the doctor drove home the next morning, he said to
himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I fixed it about that medicine;&#8221; then, his mind
reverting to the conversation at the gate, he added, &#8220;I
wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to tell her about that horse; let him tell her
himself. Blamed fool! I think I headed off his issuing
orders about that sick-bed too. Poor little girl! Now if
she&#8217;d only married Noland!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old doctor gave a long, low whistle as a sudden
thought struck him, but he put it away, and being a busy
man thought no more about it for weeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE HAVE TO SETTLE FOR OURSELVES&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>John&#8217;s being away from home those first days of
Hugh&#8217;s illness&mdash;he had gone to Colebyville to
dispose of Patsie&#8217;s body and secure a new team to
finish harvesting&mdash;kept him from getting the run of the
affairs of the sickroom, and enabled Elizabeth to assume
the care of the invalid in her own way. An idea once fixed
in John Hunter&#8217;s head was fixed, and having accepted
the plan of Doctor Morgan that Elizabeth was to be in
sole charge of care and medicine, he went his way without
thrusting his suggestions upon her, and Elizabeth, having
learned not to discuss things with him, did not speak of
her work nor of anything connected with the invalid. In
fact, as soon as John entered the sickroom she went out,
as one of the best ways she knew of to avoid accidents of
conversation. John came to Hugh&#8217;s bedside but little,
supposing that he needed rest, and willing to sacrifice his
all to the comfort of the pale invalid. With the tears
of a woman in his heart if not in his eyes, John watched
from afar the face of the man he had been the unconscious
means of injuring, and tiptoed about the outer rooms with
a fear of death which only John could feel. Another thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_468' name='page_468'></a>468</span>
kept him out of the sickroom: impressed with the idea
that his carelessness in the purchase of the first team had
led up to this trouble, he had gone to the other extreme in
replacing them, and had paid three hundred and twenty-five
dollars for one of the best and most thoroughly proven
teams in the country. There were no available funds and
he had been obliged to give a note for them; this must in
time come to Hugh&#8217;s notice, and John had a distinct remembrance
of a former note, and did not wish to repeat
the experience. Luther, who came often to see Hugh,
had spoken to John of Patsie&#8217;s death in Elizabeth&#8217;s presence,
and after the first pained expression of surprise and
grief, Elizabeth had never mentioned it again. John had
noticed also that Elizabeth had never asked the price of
the last team, nor seemed to take any interest in them,
and he hoped by the same means to avoid confessing to
Hugh.</p>
<p>John Hunter was glad at this time to escape discussions
of an unpleasant nature; he was more broken by the accident
than he ever admitted; he accused himself more
bitterly than any one would ever accuse him; he had
broken up a working team, he had killed his best horse,
and he had been all but responsible for the death of his
best friend, and when John Hunter&#8217;s own misdeeds hit
hard enough, he would face things squarely, and no matter
how hard he worked to avoid owning up to others, would
acknowledge to himself that he was in the wrong. Hugh&#8217;s
white face grew whiter each day and accused him enough
without further words. To escape it, John worked busily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_469' name='page_469'></a>469</span>
and there was need of work, for the rapidly drying fields
required his entire attention during the day, and he left
Hugh to his wife&#8217;s care, glad to do so.</p>
<p>There were times, however, when John was alone with
Hugh, and at such times, because he was full of self-blame
and humiliation, he listened to what Hugh said
with a peculiar attention. Hugh saw that John worried
himself half sick over his misfortune, and reached out the
hand of love and fellowship for which John hungered at
this time. He talked of his possible death as if it were
but a journey, which always convulsed John&#8217;s face with
child-like emotions. He talked of the farm work, and
kept close track of what was done. He knew that John
had had to go into debt for the team, and he wanted John
to tell him, without being asked, that a note had been
given. When he did not, Hugh passed the matter over
without reference and with a sigh. Hugh Noland was not
criticising John Hunter or any of his actions these days,
but Hugh studied John and found his weaknesses, and
tried to give him such help as he thought possible. Hugh
had long days to think, and he began to yearn over this
man to whom he had been a sort of traitor. He saw
John&#8217;s wilfulness with Elizabeth&mdash;heard many things
without being able to avoid hearing them, being pinned
to his bed&mdash;he saw where John&#8217;s irritability lost good
help during the busy season and left double duty for
faithful Jake, his supercilious attitude toward Luther,
and his illy concealed contempt for the farmers about
them, and one of his ways of keeping his mind off John&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_470' name='page_470'></a>470</span>
wife was to keep it on John and John&#8217;s needs. Hugh
kept Luther with him whenever Luther could be spared
from his home in the evenings, and he spoke to John of
Luther with growing affection. When he grew stronger,
he discussed farm work and farmers with John in a way
that savoured of interest in their problems; he asked
Nathan and Silas and Carter and Bob Warren in
and talked to them of fertilizers and drainage, and
when John insisted that those things were in the future,
he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but they will come up in our time; you see I come
from a place where those things were already a necessity
to the farmers. I am a farmer myself now and I think
about those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh knew that his consideration of fertilizers was
superfluous in a country that was hardly past the sod-corn
stage, but he longed to dignify this work to John
Hunter, since John would give his formative years here
and be unable to do other things if he ever made money
enough to get away, as he hoped. Hugh had had enough
work in the agricultural department of an eastern university
before he had come to Kansas, to make it
possible for him to interest these men in the future
development of their state. Doctor Morgan, who had
been rather unwilling that serious subjects should be
discussed in the sickroom, asked curiously one day:</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do you want to prate such nonsense as
that to these folks for? They won&#8217;t need any kind of
fertilizers in this country for twenty years. You&#8217;d better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_471' name='page_471'></a>471</span>
be resting instead of shooting such useless stuff as that at
<i>them</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk farming to John Hunter as if it were a
respectable business to engage in, Doctor. I don&#8217;t have
to tell you how he views it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in Sam Hill&#8217;s the difference how he views it?&#8221;
the doctor asked in astonishment. &#8220;He&#8217;s nothing but a
cheap skate, and you can&#8217;t make anything else out of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh Noland looked at the doctor and made no reply;
he understood that the unfortunate vision of John Hunter
which Doctor Morgan had got would prevent him from
seeing the point he was trying to make, and so let the
matter drop, but he kept John with him evenings and
worked along on his own lines and with persistence. He
wanted to feel right about his stay in John&#8217;s home, and
one of the ways of doing it was to get close to John&#8217;s
heart on important matters. He spoke of Jack as a
future farmer, and when John indignantly resented the
implication and said that he expected his son to be an
educated man, Hugh replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course you do, but an educated farmer is
exactly the thing to make of him. Look at the clean life
you&#8217;d place him in.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so the days ran on in the sick-chamber. If John
was with Hugh, Elizabeth busied herself about the house
elsewhere, and John rarely saw them together, unless there
was medicine to administer, and then the girl gave it without
remark. A growing fear had taken possession of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_472' name='page_472'></a>472</span>
lest John should fly out at her in unpleasant fashion before
Hugh. The situation between the two had been made so
much more acute by Hugh&#8217;s accidental reference to it
when he had thought that she was crying about him, that
she was supersensitive regarding her half-formed complaint
in explanation. But for that reference, they could
have gone along indefinitely with a pretence of indifference,
but enough had been said to tear away the veil and
leave them self-conscious and mutually humiliated. Their
little avoidances of touch or tenderness spoke in a language
not to be misunderstood, and their eyes told
unconsciously all that they refused to say with their
tongues.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, in her own way, worried herself half sick
in her endeavours to care for him gently and yet give him
no cause to think she was making a demand for a love of
which neither approved, but which having once been put
into words was a constant factor in their association.
Once when she was bathing his face, Hugh thought she lingered
longer over it than was necessary and drew himself
back on his pillow suddenly, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Elizabeth. I should have my arms about you
in a minute if you did that, and you are John&#8217;s wife&mdash;and
I couldn&#8217;t look him in the face if I did a thing of that
sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned away without replying, her eyes full
of tears. He had misunderstood her cruelly. The one
thing Elizabeth Hunter was trying to do was not to show
her affection for this man who was not her husband, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_473' name='page_473'></a>473</span>
as she became worn and tired from duty at the sick-bed
it became more and more evident that she could not
accomplish it.</p>
<p>Hugh had the daily fear of her peritonitis coming back
upon her; Doctor Morgan had warned him while John was
away. Unable to lift his head from his pillow without
assistance, Hugh saw her growing thin and discouraged,
and knew that it was the enforced condition of caring for
him which made her so; yet when she tried to avoid his
sympathetic eyes, he instantly misunderstood her and
was hurt. That she was not really strong enough to
assume the care of him added to his uneasiness, and often
when he was on the point of saying so, she mistook his
glance and was so distant that it died on his lips. And
so the days ran into each other with the pair. If for any
reason one advanced, the other retreated, and at last the
condition became unbearable.</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave much and consuming thought to the
issue brought about by the fact that her husband, still
living in the house with her, had no idea that she could be
in love with another man, even though her husband no
longer loved her. Any sort of love-making was a violation
of her marriage vows, and for her to put love for
another man into words was to fall to a level to which
she had never in her life thought of doing.</p>
<p>What was she to do? John never saw anything except
in the light of his own instincts and emotions, and an idea
or a prejudice once fixed in his mind could be uprooted by
nothing but death; therefore to confess to him and thereby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_474' name='page_474'></a>474</span>
make it possible to get away from Hugh would prejudice
him against Hugh, whom he would be certain to think had
stolen something to which he alone had the right, and
against her whom he felt that he possessed, and upon
whom he could wreak almost any form of public revenge.
Hugh had tried to get away and John had himself held
him, but John could not remember that nor listen to it if
told. Every effort had been made by Hugh to avoid
Elizabeth since he had found out the true situation, but
nothing would convince John of that. Had John Hunter
the right then, being the kind of man he was, to a confession
from her that would confuse the whole issue and do
vital wrong to everybody concerned, including the baby,
who must suffer with the mother who would be made to
seem much worse than she was. This Elizabeth Hunter
asked herself daily, and with the fear that her conscience
would force her to confession should she permit any
demonstration of affection, and to avoid any possibility
of it, she became colder and colder in her manner toward
the sick man.</p>
<p>The effort to keep off dangerous ground was disastrous,
for Hugh instantly misunderstood it, and the gloom
which settled over him increased the difficulties with which
Elizabeth had to contend. Doctor Morgan saw that his
patient, who had seemed slightly better, fell back again,
and he worried about his despondent condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer him up, Mrs. Hunter! Read to him! Anything!&#8221;
he would exclaim. &#8220;He&#8217;s got to have peace of
mind, or there&#8217;s no hope in the world of his recovery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_475' name='page_475'></a>475</span>
Something more &#8217;n staved-in ribs is keeping him down,&#8221;
the doctor urged, not knowing that he laid impossible
burdens on shoulders too young to bear them.</p>
<p>The two duties, the one to her husband and the one to
her patient, stared her in the face, and she had no one
with whom to advise or consult.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! His life&#8217;s worth more than for me to
approve of myself as a wife,&#8221; she decided at last, and yet
when she gave Hugh his next dose of medicine she was
colder and more on her guard than ever.</p>
<p>Luther Hansen came to see Hugh that afternoon.
Elizabeth received an inspiration when he started away
and followed him out of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther, will he die?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Lizzie,&#8221; Luther said quietly, not knowing
what to say to such a question, and too honest to
evade.</p>
<p>At the time of the accident to the binder, when Elizabeth
knelt, broken with exhaustion and terror, looking at
the man she loved who lay under the mass of machinery
with the colour of death upon him, no one but a blind man
could have mistaken the utter abandonment of her grief,
and certainly of all men Luther was not blind. Now he
recognized the heartache back of Elizabeth&#8217;s question and
with an instinct to cheer was almost persuaded to answer
in the negative. In his heart he thought Hugh would
die. The rapidly failing strength of the man indicated
that he would do so unless something came to buoy
him up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_476' name='page_476'></a>476</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Lizzie,&#8221; he added, as if squaring his
conscience, &#8220;he looks so weak and troubled like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther realized the moment it was out of his mouth that
he had said the wrong thing. Elizabeth&#8217;s lips grew white
and she held her breath a moment as if preparing to accept
what she knew must be the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie,&#8221; asked Luther gently, &#8220;would you like to talk
to me about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face tensed strangely and her quivering lips
refused to do her bidding for a full minute, the relief was
so great.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I came out for that,&#8221; she said simply when she
could speak. &#8220;It&#8217;s so good of you to understand and
make it easy for me. I&#8217;ll walk over toward home with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked slowly through the barnyard, across the
creek, and over the pleasant pasture land. Neither spoke.
Elizabeth, now that she had decided to talk to Luther
about the circumstances with which she contended, could
not bring herself readily to do so. Luther had always the
insight of true wisdom, which let others gauge their own
inclinations. When they came to the fence which was
the boundary line between Luther&#8217;s and John Hunter&#8217;s
farms, they stopped. There was a line of willow trees
running at intervals down the fence, and Luther waved his
hand in the direction of a shady spot beside them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set down, Lizzie,&#8221; he said, seating himself half-facing
her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter crumpled up on the grass with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_477' name='page_477'></a>477</span>
back against a fence post, and thought while Luther got out
his knife and looked for something to whittle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;You want to&mdash;and&mdash;and
I&#8217;m a safe person.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, glad that he had assumed it, and
smoothed the path to confession.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re safe, Luther. You&#8217;re more than that,
God bless you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And to this man whom she had always trusted Elizabeth
poured out all her fears, her feelings, and her frantic
cry for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had no one to talk to, Luther,&#8221; she ended, &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t believe a human being can go on always and not
put things into words.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked on and on. Having started, she let him
see the consuming struggle between right and wrong which
she waged every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Morgan says, &#8216;Cheer him up! Cheer him up,&#8217;
and what am I to do?&#8221; she closed in desperation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter had told far more than she supposed.
She had bared a yearning, struggling heart to Luther&#8217;s
gaze, a soul seeking a right path where there seemed no
sure road, nothing but confusion.</p>
<p>Luther longed to help, but the problem presented insurmountable
difficulties; to adopt a rigid code of morals as
such was to come out at the end of the journey with something
in herself and society satisfied, and Hugh Noland&#8217;s
life sacrificed, as Doctor Morgan had said; to adopt a
sympathetic attitude would spare the life of a useful man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_478' name='page_478'></a>478</span>
but with her code shattered. If only she could take John
into her confidence both might be possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, you couldn&#8217;t tell Hunter, could you?&#8221; Even
as he asked it he knew it could not be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would tell John instantly if he were like you, Luther,&#8221;
was her reply. &#8220;I think Hugh himself would have been
glad to. If he could have explained, he could have got
away. No&mdash;John isn&#8217;t the kind of man. He wouldn&#8217;t
understand, and he&#8217;d make it a great deal worse than it is
to everybody. He&#8217;d accuse me and spoil Jack&#8217;s life,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The hopelessness of it left her silent for a minute, and
then Doctor Morgan&#8217;s warnings came up to be reckoned
with.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor says he&#8217;ll die if he&#8217;s worried, Luther.
What am I to do?&#8221; she demanded, wanting him to settle
the question for her, and letting the tears run unrestrained
down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Luther Hansen looked at her pityingly and shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some things we have to settle for ourselves,
Lizzie, and this is one of them for you. I do know,&#8221; he
said trustfully, &#8220;whatever you do &#8217;ll be right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interview was ended. Luther helped Elizabeth to
her feet, and went away to his own house and waiting
chores, leaving the question with her&mdash;Elizabeth
Hunter&mdash;whose life had been punctuated with interrogation
points.</p>
<p>Elizabeth walked back slowly, going over every hint and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_479' name='page_479'></a>479</span>
suggestion to be gained from Luther&#8217;s discussion of her
situation. Nothing was clear except that whatever her
decision, it must be the nearest right of anything she was
able to understand. She remembered as she stopped to
fasten the barnyard gate behind her that Luther had said
as he left her:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll go away as soon as he is able, you say,
Lizzie,&#8221; and she remembered the lingering tones of fondness
in Luther&#8217;s voice when Hugh&#8217;s name was mentioned.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Luther to say, let him die, either.</p>
<p>Elizabeth remembered at that point that Hugh&#8217;s medicine
was long overdue, that medicine was more important
just now than any of the questions with which she had
been struggling. With a frightened little cry she ran to the
house and to the sick-chamber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Elizabeth,&#8221; Hugh said when he saw her
shuffling the papers about in search of the bottle. &#8220;Jack
came in and I had Hepsie give it to me. I&#8217;ve decided
that it isn&#8217;t a good plan to have it there, and I&#8217;ll keep it
under my pillow hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I went out with Luther, Hugh, and I didn&#8217;t realize
that I was gone so long. You&#8217;ve missed two doses!&#8221;
She noticed that Hugh called her by her given name
altogether now.</p>
<p>Hugh laughed a sad little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had the one for this hour at least. I&mdash;I
tried to take it alone. I guess I won&#8217;t try that again. It
stuck in my throat and I got a strangling spell. I coughed
till&mdash;well, I thought I was going to get out of taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_480' name='page_480'></a>480</span>
medicine altogether. It&#8217;s a terrible fear that grips a fellow
when he gets something stuck in his throat and knows
that he can&#8217;t lift his head off his pillow. It isn&#8217;t so much
that he&#8217;s afraid to die&mdash;it&#8217;s the death struggle he&#8217;s afraid
of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absorbed in his own thoughts, Hugh Noland closed his
eyes and did not see the effect his words produced upon
Elizabeth. By some sort of psychological process he had
placed that death struggle before her very eyes. Hugh,
all unconscious that he had made any impression, unconscious
that her attitude toward death differed from his
own, or that his death could mean much more to her than
deliverance from the presence and care of him, lay with
his eyes closed, thinking his own bitter thoughts.</p>
<p>There was indeed enough in Hugh Noland&#8217;s appearance
to terrify the girl as he lay before her, wasted and woebegone,
his low forehead blue-veined and colourless, his
hands blue-veined and transparent, and all his shrunken
figure sharply outlined under the thin summer covering of
the bed with ghastly and suggestive significance. Instantly
she wanted to go down by his side and with her
arms about him give him the sympathy and comfort his
lonely heart craved, but because it was so deliciously
tempting she distrusted the impulse and, turning hastily,
walked out of the room and out of the house, going on a
run to her refuge in the willows. But though she agonized
till dark she found herself no nearer a solution than before.</p>
<p>Hugh felt the distance Elizabeth maintained and also
the fact that she was not well. How he hated it when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_481' name='page_481'></a>481</span>
had to lift him for his medicine. Doctor Morgan had
especially talked about her lifting when she was at first
convalescing. His heart was very bad that night.</p>
<p>About three o&#8217;clock the next afternoon Elizabeth tiptoed
in to see if he slept.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awake,&#8221; he said without opening his eyes.</p>
<p>Always when Hugh did not open his eyes Elizabeth was
filled with premonitions. He was very pinched and wan
to-day. With a pain at her own heart, Elizabeth brought
a fresh glass of water for his medicine. She had to speak
to him to get him ready to take it from her hand. Kneeling,
she put her arm under the pillow to raise his head
while he drank.</p>
<p>Hugh fumbled with the little bottle as he tried to return
the extra disks he had accidentally poured out into his
hand. Elizabeth waited till he had the cork in place, with
her arm still under the pillow. He turned his face toward
her as he thrust the bottle back, and accidentally touched
her hand under his head. He glanced up consciously.
Her breath, fresh, warm, full of the life man adores, came
to him from her parted lips, and to get away from the
impulse to say things he was resolved not to say, he closed
his eyes and turned his head feebly.</p>
<p>A gasp of fright came from the girl as she saw the contortion
of his haggard face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hugh!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The glass she held fell from her fingers and rolled to the
foot of the bed, scattering its contents abroad unobserved,
as she threw her other arm across him and lifted him for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_482' name='page_482'></a>482</span>
the air she supposed he needed. Their breaths mingled.
Human nature is but human nature, man is but man and
woman is but woman in the final analysis: they were in the
hands of a fate stronger than either of them at that moment.</p>
<p>Elizabeth struggled no more; right or wrong, it had
happened, and she brought her rocking chair and with her
free hand clasped in his, read and took life as it came.
After that, sin nor sickness could keep them from being
happy. If the girl talked of the better course of restoring
the old reserve, Hugh&#8217;s hand would reach out imploringly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Only till I get well, dearest; I won&#8217;t trouble your conscience
after that. I know you don&#8217;t feel right about this,
but I can&#8217;t go back to a life without any affection again
while I&#8217;m here,&#8221; and Elizabeth always responded to that
call. She reflected that even Luther could not condemn
her for it.</p>
<p>Yet when John was in the house or whenever she was
obliged to be careful about Hepsie, as she often was, she
was outraged in her own sight, and her colours trailed in
the dust of humiliation, for she saw that the path she was
treading was one of unaccustomed duplicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only approve of myself,&#8221; she said to Hugh,
and then was sorry she had spoken, for Hugh Noland&#8217;s
face grew more white and he closed his eyes with a little
sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling,&#8221; he said when he could speak again,
&#8220;you long for that and I like you for it too, but I&#8217;m weak.
I want to be loved and petted, and&mdash;I&#8217;m so tired that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_483' name='page_483'></a>483</span>
don&#8217;t want to think about it at all. Kiss me, sweet,&#8221; and
Elizabeth kissed him, and was glad in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not have to think till you&#8217;re well,&#8221; she
promised, and the days ran on throughout the blazing
summer, and Hugh improved, and Elizabeth won Doctor
Morgan&#8217;s admiration as a nurse.</p>
<p>In the midst of the deceptions which Elizabeth Hunter
was called upon to practise, however, she followed the
natural trend of her character in ways which proved how
fundamental truth and outrightness were in her make-up.
Having discussed Hugh with Luther, she told Hugh that
she had done so. This gave Hugh a wrong impression of
affairs between the two which she was obliged to set right.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Luther never loved me&mdash;that is, he never said
that he did. That isn&#8217;t the way we feel about each other.
We&#8217;ve just been good friends always. We herded cattle
together and told each other things all our lives. I could
tell Luther anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he couldn&#8217;t love that black-eyed thing he lives
with,&#8221; Hugh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it is myself, but he does, and Luther
never lies. You can see that he&#8217;s square with her. He
gives her a kind of companionship that will keep her out of
the position I&#8217;m in, too,&#8221; she said with conviction, and
then saw the kind of blow that she had dealt, and covered
her face with her hands for shame.</p>
<p>Elizabeth heard the invalid sigh deeply. When she
could speak again, she slid down on her knees by his bed
and, laying her arm across the shoulders of the man she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_484' name='page_484'></a>484</span>
had hurt, faced herself and her deeds squarely, as was her
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s of no use, Hugh. We&#8217;ve got to face it. I didn&#8217;t
intend to hurt you, but I&#8217;m in a serious position. I must
think of this thing all my life&mdash;and I shall shrink whenever
I do. I shall see everybody in the light of my own
life. I made no comparison between you and Luther.
There&#8217;s love and love in this world, as I&#8217;ve found out.
John thought he loved me and I thought I loved him&mdash;and
look at us! I don&#8217;t know what Luther would do if
he were placed where we are, but that is not the question.
I hurt you just now; but, oh, Hugh! I love you too&mdash;God
help me, and in the midst of it all I want my self-respect
back till I could almost die to get it. Sometimes
I think I&#8217;ll go and tell John yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>When for sheer want of breath Elizabeth stopped and
looked at Hugh Noland inquiringly, he asked eagerly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we?&#8221;</p>
<p>And for a long time she looked at him, till her eyes took
on a faraway look which said that she was going over
details and experiences of the past. In the light of those
experiences she finally shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said with simple conviction. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
know John. He&#8217;d never understand that&mdash;&mdash; Well,
he&#8217;d mix everything uselessly. It would fall hardest on
Jack; his future would be spoiled by the humiliation of
having everybody think I was worse than I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not finish her sentence for the pain on
the face before her, and hid her face on the same pillow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_485' name='page_485'></a>485</span>
and cried out her grief and heartache till Hugh had to
warn her that Hepsie might come in.</p>
<p>It was well that Elizabeth&#8217;s mind was occupied with
Hepsie while she bathed and cooled her swollen eyelids.
Long afterward she remembered Hugh had laid his arm
across his white face at that moment, but she was never
to know the fulness of the self-reproach nor the depths of
the despair which Hugh Noland suffered&mdash;Hugh, who
loved her. For himself, he did not so much care, being
a man and accustomed to the life of men in those things,
but he saw the endless round of her days, carrying with her
through them all the secrecy and shame of it; she who loved
openness! If she had been a woman who looked herself
less squarely in the face it would have been less hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll talk to Luther too,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t drive Patsie over for him this evening,
could you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked down at him in surprise as she wiped
her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, I thought you knew about Patsie,&#8221; she
said hesitatingly. &#8220;Patsie&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She died the night you were hurt. John drove
her for Doctor Morgan,&#8221; the girl said, wishing that she
could keep the news from him.</p>
<p>After that first startled exclamation Hugh did not
remark on the mare&#8217;s death; he noticed that Elizabeth
never blamed John for things when talking of him, and he
liked her for it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_486' name='page_486'></a>486</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What became of the horses that day&mdash;the ones on the
binder? You kept me so stupefied at first that I sort of
forgot about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He forced from her all the vital details of the purchase
of the new horses. After he had received the answers she
felt obliged to give he did not comment upon any feature
of the story. They never criticised anything John did
between them; in fact, they rarely mentioned his name,
but Hugh was struck with the necessity of knowing
methods and facts regarding the business and asking such
simple questions as he was warranted in asking. When
the discussion was finished he asked again for Luther, and
she promised to get him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Hugh Noland had a long afternoon to think out the
situation into which he had thrust Elizabeth, for when
Elizabeth arrived at Luther&#8217;s house he had gone to town
and the sun was so hot that she rested before starting
home. Hugh was only disturbed by Hepsie, who came
once an hour to give him the drink necessary when
medicine time came around. It was lonesome with Elizabeth
away, but it let him think more clearly. Hugh saw
that he had entangled Elizabeth in a life which contained
something altogether extraneous to her whole character.
Because she was perfectly open, the greater would be the
damage which must result to her if this life went on.
One wild moment of hope had been granted him when
they had discussed the possibility of telling John. How
well Hugh remembered the searching thought Elizabeth
had given his question before she had shaken her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_487' name='page_487'></a>487</span>
The time taken to think soberly of confession told more
plainly than all her words how much she desired it. The
one thing in life which Elizabeth most disliked was
duplicity, and yet so long as he remained an invalid
their relations would be kept up. For this alone he
would have been glad to crawl on his knees to Colebyville,
though he died on the way. Something must be
done to free the girl and put her back into a life of which
she could approve. With self-respect restored, Elizabeth
was the kind of woman who would take hold of the merely
unpleasant features of her life, and in time find a way of
overcoming them. A plan began to formulate in Hugh
Noland&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>The next morning Hepsie came and asked for a few days
off to get some needed sewing done. With Hugh&#8217;s illness
and the extra work of it she had let her own work drag till
she felt that she could neglect it no longer. Elizabeth let
her go, thinking guiltily that there would be less danger of
the discovery she seemed to be ever fearing these days.
How they had gone so long without it she could not understand.
To get her dinner dishes out of the way early she
put Jack to sleep immediately after they were through
eating and then hurried the dishes so as to get in a long
afternoon&#8217;s reading. The dishes took a long time in spite
of her efforts to hurry. When at last she did finish she
hastened to the bedroom with a glass of water in her hand.
Hugh had been thinking seriously and was worn out with
the tangle of wrongdoing in which he found himself,
the solution of which involved such unsatisfactory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_488' name='page_488'></a>488</span>
changes, and now just weakly wanted to be loved. He
did not speak, but after the tablet was swallowed invited
a kiss by a glance of the eye, and when it was given, drew
her head down on his breast and lay patting it.</p>
<p>Jack had wakened and toddled into the room on his
sleepy little legs. The child staggered over to his mother
and laid his head against her arm, murmuring sleepily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Love oo too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter sprang to her feet as if a clap of thunder
had unexpectedly sent its report through the hot
afternoon air. Her guilty eyes sought Hugh&#8217;s. Jack encircled
her knees with his fat little arms and, standing
on his tiptoes to be taken, repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;Love oo too!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a noise at the well and Elizabeth, glad of a
chance to escape from the room, went out. John was
pumping water over a jug to cool it before he filled it.
The sight of the man who was her husband had a curious
effect on Elizabeth; everything in her, mentally and
physically, became chaotic, her ears buzzed, her temples
throbbed, and there was an inner shrinking which could
scarcely be controlled. John had seen her and waited for
her to come out to the well.</p>
<p>When the jug was full, John leaned forward to kiss Jack
and a sick sort of fear took hold of her lest he would offer
to kiss her also. His breath fell hot on her neck as he
sought Jack&#8217;s face on her shoulder, but he did not offer to
kiss her, and she turned away with an unspeakable relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take Jack and I&#8217;ll carry the jug out to the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_489' name='page_489'></a>489</span>
while you have a chat with Hugh,&#8221; Elizabeth said suddenly.</p>
<p>John was very tired, the field where they had been
cutting shock corn was very hot, and the house looked
cool and inviting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jug was heavier than Elizabeth had thought and
she sat down to rest on the way, observing as she did so
that Doctor Morgan was driving into the lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not absolved from blame because he scolds,&#8221; she
told herself.</p>
<p>As she thought of her duties in life, Jack&#8217;s affectionate
little speech of half an hour ago came to mind. Aye!
there was the crux of the whole difficulty. She was Jack&#8217;s
mother! A line of Emerson&#8217;s which she had read with
Hugh once came to her mind: &#8220;In my dealings with my
child, my Latin and my Greek, my accomplishments and
my money, stead me nothing. They are all lost upon him:
but as much soul as I have avails.&#8221; Her whole mind was
taken up with the quotation as soon as it came before
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;As much soul as I have avails!&#8221; Over and over she
repeated it, and when she at last saw John bearing down
upon her she got up guiltily and waited instead of going
on with the jug alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it too heavy?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take it over and
come back for you. Doctor Morgan wants to see you.
I&#8217;ll come back; it&#8217;s too hot for me; I&#8217;m going to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cool house had appealed to John Hunter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_490' name='page_490'></a>490</span></p>
<p>At the house Hugh Noland was asking searching questions
of the old doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you intend to let me get out of here, Doctor?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of here?&#8221; the doctor exclaimed. &#8220;Not till you&#8217;re
well enough. Just what do you mean by &#8216;out of here?&#8217;&#8221;
he asked in return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I said. When will I be well enough to go
to Mitchell County?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an intensity about it which caught the doctor&#8217;s
attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, Noland, you won&#8217;t go to Mitchell
County for a year with such a heart as that&mdash;it&#8217;s too far
from your friends, my boy. Be good and don&#8217;t you get
to worrying. You&#8217;ve got to stand it. Be a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had Doctor Morgan shown any tenderness Hugh
Noland would have told him the real reason for wanting
to get away, but something in the banter of being admonished
to be a man took away the thing which made it
possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then can&#8217;t I be taken into town?&#8221; Hugh asked when
he had had time to swallow the bitter pill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Into town? Now? Well, not that anybody knows of
at this time. Now look here, you&#8217;ve got a splendid place
to stay; why can&#8217;t you be sensible and lay here and get
well? You worry till I might as well go and turn this medicine
down the gullet of one of Hunter&#8217;s pigs. Be a man,&#8221;
he repeated, hoping to whip the discouraged patient into
line with good sense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_491' name='page_491'></a>491</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a case of being a man, when a woman&#8217;s got to
take care of you that had better be taking care of herself,&#8221;
Hugh said bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mrs. Hunter getting down on our hands too?
That won&#8217;t do. I&#8217;m glad we sent for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugh Noland knew that he had played his last card,
and he knew that he had lost. Elizabeth walked in at
that moment, followed by John. Doctor Morgan addressed
himself to her, taking her aside while they talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;All moonshine, Noland, old boy,&#8221; he exclaimed when
he followed Elizabeth back to the sickroom a few minutes
later. &#8220;This girl&#8217;s as sound as a dollar. Noland&#8217;s been
thinking he&#8217;s too much trouble, Mrs. Hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan saw Hugh Noland&#8217;s colour die out, and
dropped his finger on the patient&#8217;s wrist apprehensively.
Neither spoke. To change the subject, and also to get a
chance to observe the sick man under less conscious circumstances,
Doctor Morgan addressed John:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Hunter, that man you bought the team
of got in a pinch and asked me to shave the note for him.
It&#8217;s all right, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sort of electric thrill ran from each to all in the room.
Doctor Morgan understood that he had unwittingly
opened Pandora&#8217;s box; Hugh gave no sign, but though
John answered promptly and positively in the one word,
&#8220;Surely,&#8221; a warning was somehow conveyed to John that
this was more than a merely unfortunate moment. He
had been uncomfortable about the note, and under
ordinary circumstances would have been glad to have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_492' name='page_492'></a>492</span>
first knowledge of it come to Hugh in the presence of a
third party, but now, by some indefinable thing which was
neither sight nor sound, he knew that the news was not
news to Hugh, and by the same intangible, vague thing,
by some prophetic premonition, John knew that this matter
of the note was a disaster.</p>
<p>There was a long pause, finally broken by Hugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be going home by Hansen&#8217;s to-night, Doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can as well as any other way,&#8221; the doctor said, glad
to hear voices again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you ask Hansen to come over in the morning,
then?&#8221; Hugh asked.</p>
<p>Both Doctor Morgan and John Hunter looked over
at Hugh sharply, wondering what he could want of
Luther, but the sick man closed his eyes as a way of
ending the argument. Doctor Morgan dropped his
finger on the patient&#8217;s wrist again and looked at John
warningly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be going. You stay with Noland, Hunter.
I want a word with Mrs. Hunter before I go. I&#8217;ll stop at
Hansen&#8217;s, Noland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan took Elizabeth out and questioned her
closely about the diet and other important matters, but
was able to elicit nothing new.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been encouraged of late,&#8221; the old doctor said,
shaking his head, &#8220;but here he is as bad as ever&mdash;that is,
as discouraged and restless. Have you been reading to
him lately? What&#8217;s on his nerves, anyhow?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_493' name='page_493'></a>493</span></p>
<p>When the doctor could get no additional information
regarding Hugh&#8217;s condition from Elizabeth, he gave it up
and turned his attention to the girl herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him you were as fine as a dollar, but I&#8217;m not
sure about you. I&#8217;m going to bring you a tonic to-morrow.
I&#8217;ll be out in the morning, early, and I&#8217;ll try and see him
to-morrow night late. I don&#8217;t like the way he looked to-night.
Say, you don&#8217;t know what he wants of Hansen do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He asked me to go over yesterday afternoon
after him, but Luther wasn&#8217;t there and hasn&#8217;t come in
since. It&#8217;s a busy time and he probably thought very
little of it. Hugh often sends for him. Do you think he&#8217;s
worse, Doctor?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not specially,&#8221; the old doctor answered gruffly, as
he turned toward Luther Hansen&#8217;s house. He was a bit
annoyed because he thought Hugh showed too little backbone,
as he termed it.</p>
<p>John Hunter sat long beside the invalid, cut to the
quick by the languid air and shrunken frame. He wanted
to talk about the note now that it was not a secret, but
Hugh lay absolutely silent and did not open his eyes until
the lamp was brought in. At that he shifted uneasily
and asked that it be kept in the other room till needed at
medicine time. John finally gave it up and went softly
out, convinced that Hugh wanted rest and quiet. John
was broken in many ways by the continued illness for
which he felt himself responsible, and had particularly
wanted a chance to talk to-night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_494' name='page_494'></a>494</span></p>
<p>When all had gone to bed but Elizabeth, Hugh called her
to him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth answered the call, but stood at a distance
from the bed. It had come. Hugh had always known
it would, but now that it was here it was hard to face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean it, I know you do, Elizabeth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
want you to do it, but&mdash;O God! how hard it&#8217;s going
to be!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his empty arms to her for a last embrace.</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s the time to begin, Hugh. &#8216;Too,&#8217; Jack says.
That tells the whole story. I shall pollute his life also. I
shall stand, not for what I think I am, but for what I am,
in that child&#8217;s sight. I reasoned it out when you were so
ill, and I thought this was justifiable, and oh, Hugh! I&#8217;ve
dragged myself down in my own sight and I&#8217;ve dragged
you down with me. It isn&#8217;t enough for me to seem to be
right, I&#8217;ve got to <i>be</i> right,&#8221; she said in a low tone, and with
added shame because she had to keep her voice from
John&#8217;s ears&mdash;John who slept upstairs and trusted them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be easier for you, Elizabeth, if I were not
here,&#8221; Hugh Noland said sadly. &#8220;You could kill it out
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am not alone. You are here, and have got to
help me. Tell me that you will&mdash;at any cost,&#8221; she
leaned forward, and in her eagerness raised her voice till
he pointed upward warningly.</p>
<p>When she had given his medicine without a touch of
tenderness, he said to her:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_495' name='page_495'></a>495</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have bid my soul forth. I will give you that
help, at any cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made the last sentence stand out, but in her earnestness
she did not notice it or think of it again till it was
significant. She went back to her bed on the sitting-room
couch and to the broken rest allowed to those who watch
with the sick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;AT ANY COST&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The old doctor delivered the message to Luther,
and the next morning he appeared at the sickroom
door.</p>
<p>While he was talking to Hugh, Nathan Hornby came
and was called into the sickroom also. Elizabeth was too
busy with her own work to think much about this
visit, and before it was finished Doctor Morgan was
with her questioning her about the night spent by her
patient.</p>
<p>Nathan came to the kitchen while they were talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll take that youngster home with me if you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; t&#8217; be alone t&#8217; day,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan looked relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the kindest thing you could do for this
girl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Noland isn&#8217;t as well as I&#8217;d like to have
him, and she&#8217;s up every hour in the night. It takes a
hired girl to run off at a time like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth defended Hepsie at once. &#8220;Hepsie&#8217;s pure
gold. She waited a long time for Hugh to get well.
Please, Doctor, don&#8217;t make any such remark as that outside
of this house or some one &#8217;ll tell her I said it. Really,
she&#8217;s the best help a woman ever had. She&#8217;ll come back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_497' name='page_497'></a>497</span>
the first of next week. She said she&#8217;d come back any day
I&#8217;d send for her. She&#8217;d do anything for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, little woman,&#8221; Doctor Morgan
laughed. &#8220;I wish all the same that you had some one
with you so that you could stay right with that boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through the forenoon Elizabeth kept out of the
sickroom except when the medicine was due, and then got
away as fast as she could, though it was not easy to do
so, for Doctor Morgan had urged her to entertain the invalid
and keep him cheered up, letting her see that he was
more than usually worried. She meant to live up to her
resolutions, but in the afternoon Hugh was so quiet that
it seemed ominous and began to worry her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Hugh! how can I do right if you take it this way?&#8221;
she cried in despair, and would have stroked his hair if he
had not shrunk from her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Elizabeth. You have asked for help. I have
to give it in my own way. I have done harm enough to
your life. Make it as easy for me as you can, for I&#8217;m only
a man and&mdash;well, I&#8217;ve promised to help you&mdash;<i>at any
cost</i>. You&#8217;ve nothing to worry about. I&#8217;m no worse
than I&#8217;ve been,&#8221; he ended in a whisper, and closed his
eyes, as was his way when he did not want to talk.</p>
<p>The girl tiptoed out, and left him to his thoughts. Her
own were anything but satisfactory. He was more wan
and tragic than ever before, and Doctor Morgan had
especially cautioned her. She worked in the kitchen most
of the evening, keeping out of his presence, and so the
long, hard, unsatisfactory day passed, was recorded in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_498' name='page_498'></a>498</span>
annals of time, and forever gone from the opportunity to
alter or change its record.</p>
<p>Luther Hansen came in after dark. Elizabeth answered
his knock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221; he asked in astonishment when he entered the
sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Mr. Chamberlain wanted John to bring the men
over and load hogs for him. It&#8217;s been too hot to take
them to town in the daytime. Hugh&#8217;s asleep, I think,&#8221;
she said in a low tone. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t take a light in, because
he likes to be in the dark, but I spoke to him two or three
times and he didn&#8217;t answer. Are you in a hurry? I hate
to waken him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan came as they talked. He stopped to
look Elizabeth over before going to the sickroom, and
then took the lamp she handed him and, followed by
Luther, left Elizabeth standing in the dining room.
She heard the doctor&#8217;s sharp order, &#8220;Take this light,
Hansen,&#8221; and ran to help.</p>
<p>The horror, the anguish, the regret of that hour are
best left untold. The number of disks gone from the
bottle under the pillow gave the doctor his clue. One
final effort must have been made by the desperate invalid
to secure for himself the drink which would wash them
down without the dreaded coughing spell.</p>
<p>The old doctor, who loved them both, and Luther
Hansen also, witnessed Elizabeth&#8217;s despair, and listened to
her story. As Luther had said a few weeks before, he was
a safe person, and her secret remained a secret. Luther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_499' name='page_499'></a>499</span>
led her away into the night and sat silently by while her
grief spent itself in tears; it was a necessary stage. When
John and the men came, he led her back, and himself met
them at the gate to explain.</p>
<p>The morning and the evening were the first day; the
comings and goings of the inquisitive and the sympathetic
were alike unremarked by Elizabeth. Only for that first
hour did her grief run to tears; it was beyond tears. At
the coroner&#8217;s inquest she answered penetrating questions
as if they related to the affairs of others, and when at last
the weary body, whose spirit had been strong enough to
lay it aside, had been buried on the bare hillside, the
neighbours and those who came to the funeral from curiosity
agreed that Elizabeth Hunter could stand anything. So
little evidence of emotion had she given that Mrs. Crane
remarked to Mrs. Farnshaw as they rode home together:</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, Lizzie&#8217;s th&#8217; coolest hand I ever met. She
couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; liked Mr. Noland very much. She wasn&#8217;t
near as broke up as Mr. Hunter was, an&#8217; when I asked her
if she wouldn&#8217;t feel kind of spooky in that house after such
a thing, she just looked at me, funny-like, an&#8217; says &#8216;Why?&#8217;
an&#8217; didn&#8217;t seem t&#8217; care a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan drove home from the graveyard with
the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you know, Hunter, that there&#8217;s a will,&#8221; he
said before he helped Elizabeth into the buggy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Who&#8217;s got it?&#8221; John exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave it to me, with a note asking me not to read it
till after he was buried, if he should die.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_500' name='page_500'></a>500</span></p>
<p>John and Elizabeth followed the doctor&#8217;s rig home
across the long stretch of prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know that Hugh left a will?&#8221; John Hunter
asked Elizabeth, after driving a long time in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther told me last night. I didn&#8217;t think much about
it and I forgot to tell you,&#8221; Elizabeth returned briefly,
and fell back into her own sad thoughts again.</p>
<p>John Hunter looked at his wife in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luther!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered indifferently, not looking up, and
unaware that John was regarding her with a surprise
which amounted almost to suspicion.</p>
<p>John let the subject drop, but as they rode home he had
an uncomfortable sense of unpleasant things to come:
first of all why had the presence of the will been concealed
from him, Hugh Noland&#8217;s partner and closest friend?
secondly, why had Luther Hansen been told? thirdly,
why had Elizabeth declined just now to discuss it with
him after knowing about it for some time? He could not
put his finger on the exact trouble, but John Hunter was
affronted.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was that Elizabeth had only
heard of the will the night before, and had been too
stunned by other things to care much about it. If she
had thought about it at all she would have supposed that
John had been told also, but Elizabeth had been occupied
with troubles quite aside from material things, and now did
not talk because she was concerned with certain sad aspects
of the past and almost as sad forebodings for the future.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_501' name='page_501'></a>501</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You better come in too, Hansen,&#8221; Doctor Morgan
said to Luther, when they arrived at the Hunter house.</p>
<p>Sadie had stayed with Hepsie at the house, and Luther
had expected to take her and go straight home. The two
women had been busy in the three hours since the body
of Hugh Noland had been taken from the house. The
mattress which had been put out in the hot sun for two
days had been brought in, and order had been restored to
the death chamber. There was a dinner ready for the
party of sorrowing friends who had loved the man that
had been laid to his final rest, and it was not till after it
was eaten that the subject of the will was mentioned again.</p>
<p>They sat about the table and listened to Doctor Morgan&#8217;s
remarks and the reading of the important document.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; Doctor Morgan began, &#8220;a letter from Mr.
Noland written the day before his death, in which he tells
me that he has made a will of which I am to be made the
sole executor. In that letter he enclosed another sealed
one on which he had written instructions that it was not to
be opened till after his death. I opened the latter this
morning, and in it he states frankly that he has decided to
voluntarily leave his slowly dissolving body, and spare
further pain to those he loves. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps I
could have helped him, if I&#8217;d known. I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; the
old doctor said brokenly. &#8220;He asked me to do something
for him that I guess I ought to have done, but I thought he
was all right as he was, and I wouldn&#8217;t do it. However,
he asked me as his executor to see to it that every provision
of this will, which I have never seen, be carried out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_502' name='page_502'></a>502</span>
to the letter. Hansen, here, is one of the witnesses he tells
me, and Hornby is the other. It is unnecessary for me to
say that I shall have to carry out these instructions as I
have been commanded to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to John, he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, Hunter, that there&#8217;s nothing in this that will
work any inconvenience to you, and I hardly think it will.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter sat through the opening of the envelope
and the rapid survey which Doctor Morgan gave its contents
before he began to read, stirred by varying emotions.
Suspicion crawled through his brain, leaving her slimy
trail; why had there been need of secrecy? Why had all
these people been told, and he, John Hunter alone, left
out? Nathan Hornby and Luther Hansen witnesses!
But most of all, as was to be expected, his suspicions were
directed toward Elizabeth. She had known&mdash;she probably
knew from the beginning. She was in the conspiracy.
Of the fact of a conspiracy John Hunter felt certain
when Doctor Morgan cleared his throat and began to
read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Hunter&#8217;s Farm,</span></p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Colebyville, Kansas,</span></p>
<p>August 22, 18&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Know all men by these presents that I, Hugh Noland, being of sound mind and
memory, not acting under duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence of any person whatsoever,
do make, publish, and declare this my last will and testament.</p>
<p>First, I order and direct that all my just debts be paid by my executor, hereinafter
named.</p>
<p>Second, I expressly provide, order, and direct that all my estate, consisting of one
half of the lands and chattels of the firm of &#8220;Hunter and Noland&#8221; shall be settled by my
executor, hereinafter named, without the intervention of the courts, and given, whole
and entire, to Elizabeth Hunter, and to her heirs and assigns forever, and that the
division be a legal division, so arranged that all deeds to the land and all rights to the
personal property shall be legally hers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_503' name='page_503'></a>503</span></p>
<p>This I do as an inadequate return for all she has done and tried to do for me.</p>
<p>Lastly, I hereby nominate and appoint George W. Morgan, M. D., sole executor of
this my last will and testament, to serve without bonds or the intervention of any court.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof I hereunto set my hand and seal, and publish and declare this
my last will and testament, on this twenty-second day of August, in the year of our
Lord 18&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>Signed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Hugh Noland</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Witnesses:
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Luther Hansen,</span>
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Nathan Hornby.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There was a pause. Surprise held every person present,
for the witnesses had seen only their signatures up to now,
not the will, and Doctor Morgan was no less astonished
than the rest. At last he reached his hand across the
table to Elizabeth saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an instrument that I shall get some pleasure at
least from administering, Mrs. Hunter. You deserve it.
I&#8217;m glad it goes to you. It&#8217;s like the boy! God rest his
weary soul, and forgive his impatience to be off! we&#8217;ll
miss him,&#8221; he added brokenly.</p>
<p>Elizabeth sat with her hands clasped on the table in
front of her, neither hearing nor seeing more. She was
unaware that she was the object of everybody&#8217;s attention
and that all eyes were turned on her. The merely material
items contained in that instrument were of little
moment to her just then; to every one else, except perhaps
Luther, they were all that there was of importance.
Sadie Hansen looked at her young neighbour, overcome
by the fact that she was to have several thousand dollars
all her own; Luther&#8217;s gray eyes dwelt upon her affectionately,
glad that this last evidence of Hugh Noland&#8217;s
sacrifice was hers; Doctor Morgan thought of the power it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_504' name='page_504'></a>504</span>
would give her to control the financial side of her life, and
John Hunter was glad that at least the money was to remain
in the business, and ready to forget the supposed plot.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was aroused by Doctor Morgan placing a
sealed envelope in her hand and saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;This seems to be for you, Mrs. Hunter. It was in this
big envelope with the will, and I didn&#8217;t see it till just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was so surprised that she turned the envelope
over two or three times and read her name carefully to
realize that the letter was for her, and from Hugh&#8217;s own
hand. When at last it was clear to her, her face flushed
with confusion, and the first tears which had dimmed her
eyes since the hour of his death came to her relief. But
the tears did not fall. Realizing that the eyes of all
present were upon her, she controlled herself, and rising
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me one moment, till I have read it,&#8221; and
passed into her own bedroom, where, with the sense of his
presence, she clasped it to her tenderly an instant, and
still standing, broke the seal.</p>
<p>It was simple, sincere, and so formal that all the world
might have read it, and yet, it said all that she would have
wanted him to say.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Elizabeth</span> [it began]: When this reaches your hand, my heart will have
ceased to trouble either of us. I will have fought my little fight; I will have kept the
faith&mdash;which I started out too late to keep. The little I leave you will be small
recompense for all I have cost you, but it is all I have, and will, I hope, help toward
emancipating you from care. My one earnest bit of advice to you is, <i>keep it free from
debts</i>.</p>
<p>I wish I might have spared you these last few days and their various burdens, but I
am sure they will be less heavy than if I chose to wait.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Hugh</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_505' name='page_505'></a>505</span></div>
<p>Elizabeth Hunter returned to the table with the open
letter, which she handed to Doctor Morgan saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it aloud, Doctor,&#8221; and stood behind her chair
with her head bowed while it was being done.</p>
<p>When it was finished, she looked about her, measuring
the different members of the group, wondering if it said
the things to them which it cried aloud to her. The
survey was satisfactory, till she suddenly realized that
John was not there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s John,&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone out to see Nate Hornby&mdash;he&#8217;s brought the
baby,&#8221; Luther answered.</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan started for home, taking the will with
him to have it legally probated, and Elizabeth took Jack
from his father&#8217;s arms, and went back to put away her
letter, forgetting that John had not heard it read. Nathan
came to spend the rest of the day. He knew from personal
experience the cheerlessness of the house which has but
lately harboured the dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>FACING CONSEQUENCES</h3>
</div>

<p>The next Sunday John was thrown in upon Elizabeth
for entertainment. He had been a little
more tender with her since the funeral, reflecting
that women were easily upset by death and that this death
had been particularly tragic in its sadness and disturbing
features. He missed Hugh, and an intangible something
about the will made him uncomfortable; but they would
be rich in time and he could simply oversee the business,
and life would be more satisfactory. If he thought of
Luther and Nathan as witnesses, the thought was made
partially acceptable since they could see that Hugh had
placed the property in his, John Hunter&#8217;s, hands. When
the uncomfortable things wormed their way forward and
would be considered, he tried to reason them out. Some
features of it could be accounted for; for instance, he,
John Hunter, had probably not been consulted by Hugh
for legal reasons, since the money was to come to them.
Hugh must have considered that. But Elizabeth had
known! He had forgotten that. Right there John went
into a brown study. Had she known before Hugh&#8217;s
death? It was queer, but she never mentioned Hugh
these days, nor the will, nor&mdash;no, she did not speak of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_507' name='page_507'></a>507</span>
letter, much less offer to show it to him. Still, the money
was theirs. That was the solid rock under John Hunter&#8217;s
feet. Whatever else happened, the money was theirs.
Now he could open out and farm on a scale befitting a
man of his parts. They would make something yet.
This farming venture had not turned out so badly after
all.</p>
<p>A slight rain was falling, the first in two months, two of
the most important months in the year; but it was only a
drizzle and not enough to benefit the corn, which&mdash;even
the last planting&mdash;was ruined. The heat and drought
had forced a premature ripening, and the stubby ears,
fully formed, were empty of developing grains, except
near the butts. It was discouraging to lose the corn, and
John, to take the place of the shortened crop, had had a
field plowed and sewed to millet. A promise of rain
meant a probable crop of that substitute for the heavier
grain, but it must be rain, not a mere shower. Disappointed
at the stingy display of water, John wandered
about the house, disturbed by Jack&#8217;s noise, and irritably
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in and sit down,&#8221; he urged when he saw that
Elizabeth intended to help Hepsie with the dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Let the work go, Hepsie, and I&#8217;ll do it
later,&#8221; Elizabeth said quietly. She dreaded an hour with
John when he was in that mood, but there seemed to be no
help for it.</p>
<p>The two women cleared the dinner table and righted
the dining room before they stopped, then Elizabeth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_508' name='page_508'></a>508</span>
closed the kitchen door and left the dishwashing till
she could get away from the conference requested.
Hepsie had hurried to get started early for her home
and Elizabeth had entered into her plans and offered
assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let Hepsie finish them alone?&#8221; John
said petulantly.</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no reply, but took Jack on her lap and
rocked him to keep herself occupied. There was less
opportunity for disagreement if the child were still while
his father talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this rain&#8217;d only get busy we&#8217;d have a crop of millet
yet,&#8221; John began. &#8220;Corn&#8217;s going to be mighty high and
scarce this fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not reply; something in the air warned
her to let John do the talking. She had ceased to enter
into conversation with him unless something vital made it
necessary to speak. The vital thing was not long in forthcoming.
The whimsical weather made him depressed and
kept his mind on the gloomy crop outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound this beastly drizzle! If it&#8217;d only get down
to business and rain we&#8217;d pull out yet. There&#8217;ll be corn
to buy for the cattle and the very devil to pay everywhere.
I&#8217;ve got to lengthen out the sheds over those feeders&mdash;it
hurried the cattle to get around them last winter&mdash;and
here&#8217;s all these extra expenses lately. There&#8217;s no way out
of it&mdash;we&#8217;ve got to put a mortgage on that west eighty.
I&#8217;ll take up the horse note in that case, and Johnson&#8217;s
offering that quarter section so cheap that I think I&#8217;ll just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_509' name='page_509'></a>509</span>
make the loan big enough to cover the first payment and
take it in. We&#8217;ll never get it as cheap again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes were wide open now, but she considered
a moment before she began to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; she said slowly at last. &#8220;We&#8217;re
out of debt, except your personal note for the five hundred
and the one for the team. It won&#8217;t do to mortgage
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll have to mortgage, with the crop short, and
all those cattle!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell a part of them as grass cattle, and use the money
to buy corn for the rest,&#8221; she advised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grass cattle are soft and don&#8217;t weigh down like corn-fed
steers. It would be sheer waste,&#8221; John insisted.</p>
<p>Elizabeth understood that right now they were to test
their strength. She thought it over carefully, not speaking
till she had decided what to say. The old path of
mortgages and interest meant the old agony of dread of
pay-day and the heart eaten out of every day of their
existence, and yet she was careful not to rush into discussion.
Her voice became more quiet as she felt her way
in the debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right as far as you go, grass cattle do not sell
for as much, but, on the other hand, a loan means interest,
and there is always a chance of the loss of a steer or two and
then the profit is gone and you have your mortgage left.
Luther said yesterday that they had black-leg over north
of home, and you know how contagious it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Luther! Of course Luther knows all there is to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_510' name='page_510'></a>510</span>
know about anything,&#8221; sneered her husband, to whom
Luther was a sore point just now.</p>
<p>Elizabeth realized her mistake in mentioning Luther&#8217;s
name to John almost before it was out of her mouth.
John&#8217;s instincts made him bluster and get off the subject
of business and on to that of personalities at once. She did
not reply to the taunt, but went quietly back to the point
of business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The price of corn,&#8221; she said with perfect control,
&#8220;will go way up after this dry weather, but the price of
beef doesn&#8217;t always rise in proportion. Besides that, this
is a bad year to get tied up in the money market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to do it all the same,&#8221; John
replied, spurred on by the mention of Luther&#8217;s name to
compel her consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, we can&#8217;t do it. Hugh especially directed in his
letter that we must not go into debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not had the honour of seeing Hugh&#8217;s letter to
you, and therefore I do not know,&#8221; John returned. That
was another sore point.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t! Doctor Morgan read it to all the
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had forgotten that John had not heard the
letter read, and rose promptly and went for it. She laid
it on the table at his elbow when she returned saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten&mdash;you didn&#8217;t hear it when the doctor
read it that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter brushed it aside with his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to see it, thank you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_511' name='page_511'></a>511</span></p>
<p>The letter fell on the floor. Elizabeth stooped quickly
and picked it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may do as you wish about that; I shall not consent
to the mortgage just the same,&#8221; she said, her temper
getting the better of her at last. She turned to the bedroom
to put the letter away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, Elizabeth!&#8221; John called after her.</p>
<p>Seeing the ineffectiveness of carrying on the conversation
when they were not face to face, John waited till
she returned. When she was seated again and had begun
to rock the restless child once more, he began:</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well understand each other right now as
any time. If you&#8217;re going to run this place, I want to
know it, and I&#8217;ll step down and out.&#8221;</p>
<p>John looked belligerent and waited for her to do her
womanly duty and give in. Elizabeth made no reply.
John waited. He continued to wait for some seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not consent to a mortgage,&#8221; was the quiet
answer.</p>
<p>John Hunter flung himself out of the house.</p>
<p>It was a bad afternoon for John. The drizzle had
hardly been enough to lay the dust, but had made it
impossible to walk through the grass or over the fields; his
pride made it impossible for him to go back to the house,
and so there was no place open to him except the hayloft,
where he turned his own gloomy thoughts over and
reasoned out this new development. A day&#8217;s pouting, he
was certain, would win his point; it would probably be all
right when he went back at supper time, but he saw difficulties
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_512' name='page_512'></a>512</span>
ahead with Elizabeth feeling that she had a right
to an opinion regarding the property.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall let her see that I mean business all the same.
I&#8217;m not going to have her interfering in my work. Let
her attend to her own, as a woman ought to do,&#8221; he
concluded.</p>
<p>He did wish, however, that he had read the letter.
Doctor Morgan had referred to the letter also as being
authority. He had an uncomfortable feeling that if he
ever saw that letter that he would have to ask again;
Elizabeth was a little less easy of late to manage than she
had been that first year; she could put a thing aside and
not discuss it almost as well as he could.</p>
<p>At that point John&#8217;s mind flamed up against Luther
Hansen. Elizabeth was always quoting Luther. He
was glad he had let her see just now that she need not
quote that common Swede to him any more. He didn&#8217;t
know a necktie from a shoelace! Hugh might have asked
him to witness the will, but Hugh had seen fit to leave the
money to them, all the same. Whatever else hurt, the
money was his, and he&#8217;d turn everything into cattle, and
get rich, and get out of this damned hole.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, in the house, was doing her own thinking.
The conversation just finished had indications. She saw
that her husband had a definite policy in regard to the
management of the property, that he did not mean to let
her have any more to do with it than when it was all his
own. A creeping suspicion came to her that if she
refused to consent to further mortgages her husband
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_513' name='page_513'></a>513</span>
might leave her. There had been a violence in his tones
as well as in his manner beyond any he had ever assumed
toward her. Elizabeth shrank in a heartsick way from
the contest. If he would mortgage the one eighty and
then stop she would far rather have given away that much
land than to have the quarrel, but that she knew he
would not do. She could not for a moment think of
giving up if she expected to have a roof over her head
that was unencumbered when she was old. Though half
the property was now hers by actual right, she would not
interfere with anything he wished to do with it except to
place a loan against it. If he insisted upon mortgages,
though their disagreement became a scandal, she resolved
that she would not consent.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>John ate his supper without speaking to any one, and
waited from then till bedtime for his answer, but Elizabeth
gave no sign. The next day he waited, and the next,
with increasing uneasiness and alarm. He decided at
last to force her consent.</p>
<p>The third day he put one of the new horses in the single
buggy and left the place without saying where he was
going, and not even when he returned in the evening did
he mention what his errand had been.</p>
<p>The following morning a team was driven into the side
lane and Elizabeth saw John meet the driver and help him
tie his horses. There was the air of a prearranged thing
between them, and as they came toward the house it
flashed through her mind what had been done. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_514' name='page_514'></a>514</span>
whole form straightened instinctively and she grasped
her broom rigidly as she left the dining room and went to
her own bedroom to get control of herself before she
should have to meet the stranger. She realized that the
man was the Johnson John had spoken of as having the
quarter section of land for sale. She was to be called upon
to act. The thing she must do she knew was right; could
she make the manner of the doing of it right also? She
would not humiliate him if she could help it; she stayed in
her room, hoping that he would come to call her himself
and then she could warn him when he was alone, but John
would not meet her except in the presence of the stranger,
and sent Hepsie to call her. There was no help for it, and
Elizabeth went as she was bidden&mdash;went quietly, and
was introduced to the neighbour whom she had never
seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Johnson has accepted my proposition, Elizabeth,
to give him twenty-five dollars an acre for the quarter
next to ours,&#8221; John said after all were seated.</p>
<p>The girl waited quietly. She noticed that John did not
mention the terms of payment, and waited for him to
commit himself on that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where those blank deeds are? We can
make one out while we conclude the details, and then go
in to Colebyville to-morrow and have a notary take our
signatures,&#8221; John concluded easily.</p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated visibly, and John had a startled
moment, but she went for the blanks at last, as he directed.
The two men sat with their heads together, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_515' name='page_515'></a>515</span>
wrote carefully in the numbers and legal description of
the land.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the party of the first part further agrees that the
sum of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; John was reading as he wrote it in. His
voice ran on to the close. When the writing was finished
the man Johnson rose, and, picking up his straw hat, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be hurrying on toward home now. I&#8217;ll
stop in on the way to-morrow morning. You&#8217;d just as
well ride with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll have to take Mrs. Hunter in with me,&#8221; John
replied, &#8220;and I can just as well hitch up to my own
rig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you taking me in with you for, John?&#8221;
Elizabeth asked, perfectly quiet on the outside, but
aquiver with humiliation and dread because of the thing
she was being compelled to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;To fix up the papers on the west eighty; you know It&#8217;ll
be necessary for you to sign them too.&#8221; Addressing Mr.
Johnson, he added easily: &#8220;My wife objects to going into
debt, Mr. Johnson, but I felt this too good an opportunity
to let pass, and since we can arrange it so that I won&#8217;t
have to raise but a thousand dollars just now, I&#8217;m sure
She&#8217;ll see the advisability of the move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth considered a second before she began to
speak, and then said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hunter does not understand the nature of my
objection, I see. Of course if he can arrange it with you
so that all the indebtedness falls on the land he is buying,
I should have no objections whatever, but we cannot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_516' name='page_516'></a>516</span>
mortgage our home. The provisions of the will forbid it,
and I shall live up to those provisions absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence which followed was vocal with astonishment.
The man looked from husband to wife for signs of
quarrelling, but Elizabeth returned his gaze quietly, and
without signs of anger, and John also gave no indication
of anything but surprise. After a gasping instant, during
which his instincts warned him to keep on the side of
decency, John accepted the situation with seeming calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Johnson, if Mrs. Hunter feels that way
about it, there&#8217;s nothing to do. I&#8217;m sorry to have
brought you over on a fool&#8217;s errand,&#8221; he said suavely,
&#8220;but it can&#8217;t be helped now. We&#8217;ll take the land later,
however,&#8221; and ushered his guest out of the house and
helped him untie his team without any sign of the tempest
within.</p>
<p>John went back to the house with no concealment and
no cajolery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well know where we are and what we mean
to do right here and now, Elizabeth,&#8221; he began. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re going to do this kind of thing, I want to know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was ready for the storm, and met it without
flurry. She looked at her husband quietly, steadily,
sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall sign no mortgages, if that is what you are in
doubt about,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had not intended to ask for a
legal division of the property, but since you demand the
right to make loans, I shall not cripple your plans with
what is your own. I will have my part set aside; you can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_517' name='page_517'></a>517</span>
farm it in any way you choose, but you can only mortgage
what is yours. I would have told you so if you had played
fair and discussed this thing with me instead of leaving
the house or blustering. You can tell me what you mean
to do where I am concerned&mdash;you would if I were a man&mdash;or
you can take just what you did to-day. You try
to put me where I can&#8217;t help myself before strangers when
you want me to do a thing you know I don&#8217;t think I ought
to do; and you can&#8217;t handle me that way any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter had been working himself into a passion as
he listened and burst out:</p>
<p>&#8220;And You&#8217;ll work for the best interests of this farm,
that&#8217;s what You&#8217;ll do! Every time I ask you to sign a
paper you make a little more fuss. Because I got in
pretty deep before is no sign I&#8217;m going to do it again, and
when I tell you to sign anything You&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His feet were very wide apart, and he thrust his face
forward at her, his eyes glaring into hers with every trick
which instinct prompted him to use in compelling her
obedience.</p>
<p>Elizabeth barely glanced at him, and then looked down
at the floor, quietly considering in what way she should
reply to such an attack.</p>
<p>John was disconcerted; his little stage play had fallen
flat.</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s pause, Elizabeth began very quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not interfere with anything you do about the
land which has been left to me, except that I will not have
one cent of mortgage on it. If you will keep out of debt,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_518' name='page_518'></a>518</span>
you can manage it any way you choose, but I will have
every step of the business explained to me which involves
the safety of my home, and it will be explained to me
beforehand&mdash;or the same thing will happen that has just
happened. I will not be deceived, even in little things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked him squarely and kindly in the face, but
her look was as firm as if he had not blustered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not deceived you. I brought this man here
and explained the whole thing before your face, besides
telling you the other day that I intended to have that
land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are shuffling with the truth, and you know it,&#8221;
she said sternly. &#8220;You did not tell me you had made any
arrangements with him, nor that you intended to do so,
only in a general way. You thought you&#8217;d catch me
before him when it came to signing the papers, and then
you thought I couldn&#8217;t help myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not tried to deceive you! I brought him here
and explained every detail,&#8221; he said with such a righteous
appearance of innocence that Elizabeth was tempted to
laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;ve fallen to a pretty state of affairs when
my own wife hints at my having lied to her,&#8221; John insisted.</p>
<p>Elizabeth spoke slowly, measuring her words, realizing
that the crisis of their lives was upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not accuse you any more, but I will explain the
plan on which I will do business with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t bother,&#8221; John interrupted sarcastically.
&#8220;I will let you run it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_519' name='page_519'></a>519</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will not go into debt,&#8221; Elizabeth continued as
calmly as if he had not interrupted. &#8220;That is the absolute
decision I have come to. You will not explain to me
<i>after</i> you have decided to do a thing and in the presence
of other people, where my property and my freedom are
concerned. On the other hand, if you are determined to
go into debt and branch out into a larger business, I feel
that I cannot deny you the right to do as you wish with
what is your own, and if you choose to do so will divide
the property and leave you as free to mortgage and sell
as if you were not married to me. I will leave you as free
as I ask to be myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Free! Free to be made a fool of. No, ma&#8217;am; you
don&#8217;t run any such gag as that on me. The people in this
community are only too anxious to talk about me; they&#8217;d
roll it under their tongues like a sweet morsel, that as soon
as you got hold of the money you put the screws on me.
You gave Johnson just such a handle this afternoon as
that. You&#8217;ll behave yourself, and look after your house
and child as a woman ought to do, and I&#8217;ll take charge of
the work out of doors as a man ought to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth interrupted him eagerly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now right there, John, you have struck the very heart
of the thing which first made me feel that I must take care
of myself in my own way. You have never allowed me
to bake a pie or a loaf of bread, nor churn, nor anything
without you told me how to do it; and then you feel that
you have the right to mortgage the home right over my
head and think I have no rights in the matter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_520' name='page_520'></a>520</span></p>
<p>It was John&#8217;s turn to interrupt eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who put that home over your head?&#8221; he asked, for
the first time addressing himself to the real issue of the
home.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at him steadily. She was surprised
to find herself talking thus quietly, she who had been so
prone to emotional hindrances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I have been in your house I have had my food
and clothes. I don&#8217;t have to tell you that my mere work
is worth far more than that. I have borne you a child.
Motherhood entitles me to a share in the estate, since I
have the child on my hands; besides, I could have been
teaching school these years and not only earned my living
but have been free to go and come as I have never been
free here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That has nothing to do with it. You are married and
your duty lies here as well as your work. It&#8217;s a wife I
want. If you&#8217;re going to be a wife, be one; if you&#8217;re
going to be a boss, I want to know it, and I&#8217;ll get
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two things I will have my say about: I will not mortgage
the half of the land which is mine, and I will not be
interfered with when I have to correct Jack,&#8221; Elizabeth
said slowly. &#8220;Also when I see fit to go anywhere I shall
go hereafter. I was never allowed to go to see Aunt
Susan, and she went down to her death thinking I didn&#8217;t
want to come. Of course that&#8217;s different now: I do go
when I want to these days, but I got my first warning
right there that I must take care of myself. You don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_521' name='page_521'></a>521</span>
intend to tell me anything about what you mean to do
with me, ever, if you can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go into Colebyville and sign the papers on that
land all the same,&#8221; John said doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will sign no papers till there is a legal division of the
property, John. I mean what I say. I&#8217;ll let people talk
if you crowd me before them,&#8221; the girl said decisively.</p>
<p>John glared at her in desperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it! no wonder folks talked the week we were
married! I&#8217;ve been humiliated ever since I brought you
into this house,&#8221; the man cried, breaking into a passion
again. &#8220;A pretty figure You&#8217;ll cut, with this last thing
added to your reputation. Everybody knows you
couldn&#8217;t get along with your father. I let you down easy
with Johnson just now, in spite of the humiliating place
you put me in, but if you think I&#8217;m going to be driven
at your beck and call you&#8217;re mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>John stopped to give effect to his words. He was just
beginning to realize that Elizabeth was not giving up, and
that it was a fight to the finish. The feature John disliked
was that it was a fight in the open. Well, let her
fight in the open, she should see that he would not be
beaten.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, to be less conscious of the eyes glaring at her,
picked up her sewing, which had been tossed on the lounge
an hour ago, and began to ply her needle.</p>
<p>John broke out anew, really losing control of himself
this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most outrageous thing I ever heard of&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_522' name='page_522'></a>522</span>
woman humiliating her husband by refusing to sign papers
when he has brought the man right into the house to fix
them up! A pretty reputation I&#8217;ll get out of it! It&#8217;s
sickening, disgusting. What do you expect me to do?
Tell me that. If I want to buy a load of hay or a boar pig,
am I to say to a man, &#8216;Wait till I ask my wife if I can?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood leering at her, hot with passion, determined to
make her speak. The vulgarity of his discussion nauseated
her, but since she must discuss, she was resolved to do
it quietly and on decent ground as far as she was concerned.
Without fear she replied slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well what I have asked of you,
John. You won&#8217;t gain anything by blustering. I mean to
be consulted on all important matters like loans, deeds,
and mortgages, exactly as you&#8217;d consult with a man, and
I intend to be consulted <i>before</i> the thing is done, and not
have you take advantage of me in the presence of strangers.
You needn&#8217;t shuffle matters. You understand what
I mean, and you can&#8217;t fool me. Be sensible and do the
right thing by me, and give me the chance to do the right
thing by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done the right thing by you already, and I&#8217;ll go
about my own affairs as a man should, and You&#8217;ll attend
to your own affairs as a woman should if you live with
me, and leave me free to act like a man. Do you understand
that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, John,&#8221; she said, falling back to the needle,
which she had let rest again for a moment. There was a
little choke in her voice, but she was firm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_523' name='page_523'></a>523</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he asked, suspicious
that she was not giving up as he intended that she should
do.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just what I said a minute ago: I will let you
mortgage your half of this farm after it is divided, but I
will not sign any such papers on the other half. I will
not be taken advantage of before strangers; I will let them
talk first, and I will take care of my house as I see fit.
Also, I will not speak when you manage Jack, and you
will not interfere when I have to do it&mdash;that is, we will
not interfere with each other <i>before the child</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hunter&#8217;s face turned scarlet, his cheeks stung as if
he had been slapped; she was not giving in at all! He
stood before her incensed beyond words for a moment,
breathing hard and almost bursting with what he considered
the insult of it; then the blood which had mounted
to his head receded and left him deadly white.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly understand you,&#8221; he said in level tones,
&#8220;but you shall understand me. I will never be made a
fool of by you again; if you&#8217;re going to run things, say it
out, and I&#8217;ll let you have it and run it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hopeless; she did not reply, but stitched in and
out on Jack&#8217;s little frock, sick at heart with the shame of
such a quarrel, since it was to accomplish nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me!&#8221; he thundered.</p>
<p>Elizabeth laid her sewing on the lounge beside her, and
rose to her feet. She looked him squarely in the face and
answered as he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will sign no papers of which I do not approve, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_524' name='page_524'></a>524</span>
certainly none which I have been deceived about in any
way. Aside from that you are free to run the farm as you
wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take the whole damned thing, and I&#8217;ll go back
to mother and make a home for her. She was never
allowed to have a home in this house after you came into
it,&#8221; he flung out. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the Mitchell County land,
and you can have what&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s what you and
Hornby and Hansen planned from the first, I should judge.
That&#8217;s why you got Noland to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thrusting his hat down to his very ears, he strode from
the house, swinging the screen door behind him so hard
that it broke and the split corner fell out and hung dangling
by the net, which kept the splintered frame from falling
to the ground.</p>
<p>Elizabeth closed the panelled door to keep out the
flies, and turned quietly to the bedroom for her bonnet.
She spoke to Hepsie, who had heard the entire argument,
as she passed through the kitchen, asking her to keep Jack
for her, and walked through the barnyard, through the
wet pasture, and on to her haunt in the willows, where she
could think undisturbed.</p>
<p>John was still standing in the harness room of the barn
when he heard the door close behind Elizabeth, and saw
her coming that way.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was coming to the barn! He gave a start of
surprise. Even while he had not given up all thought of
her coming to his terms, he wondered at her giving in so
promptly. John drew back so that she should not see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_525' name='page_525'></a>525</span>
that he was watching her. When she did not immediately
appear he thought with a smile of satisfaction that
she had stopped, not finding it easy to approach after the
haughty manner in which she had just dismissed his
demands. He waited a moment, considering terms of
capitulation, and then walked unconcernedly out.</p>
<p>The truth broke upon him. She had passed the barn,
she was on her way to the willows, not to him. Something
in John Hunter sickened.</p>
<p>Up to the moment when John had seen his wife coming
toward him he had been fully prepared to stand by the
terms of dissolution which he had made. But in that
moment when he watched her recede from him in the
direction of the willows, the tide of his feelings turned; he
wished he had not issued his ultimatum; he wished he had
not put it to the test.</p>
<p>The triumph of receiving her submission had been his
first thought when he had seen her come from the house,
and it had been a sweet morsel while it had lasted, but
when he had seen her going from him toward the willows,
he suddenly realized that triumph had slipped from
his grasp. Suddenly he desired to possess her. Not since
the first six weeks of their acquaintance had Elizabeth
looked so fair to him. He had put her away! A great
sob rose up in him. He had said that he would go back to
his mother, and his fate was sealed. He had gone to the
barn to saddle his horse and start on the instant for
Mitchell County and the cattle he had chosen as his
portion, but all at once the glamour of his going died away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_526' name='page_526'></a>526</span>
and he saw the choice he had made. To crown his cheerless
flight, Jack was at Nathan Hornby&#8217;s, and pride would
not let him follow the child up even when he was going
away forever. Nate Hornby had had something to do
with this business of Elizabeth getting the money, and he
had also had something to do with her determination to
take the money out of his, her husband&#8217;s, hands, and he,
John Hunter, would not humble himself before him.
Long before Elizabeth&#8217;s return from the willows her husband
was away.</p>
<p>Great was Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s surprise when John did
not appear at supper. She had not taken him seriously;
he had always blustered, and while she had realized that
he was angry enough to make his word good, she had supposed
that he would make a division of the property if he
intended to leave her, and make arrangements for the
child. She did not believe that he was gone, and answered
the observations and questions of the hired men by saying
that he had probably gone for the baby. In fact, having
once said it, it sounded plausible to her, and she waited
till far into the night for the sound of his horse&#8217;s footsteps.</p>
<p>The suspicion which at midnight was yet a suspicion was
by morning a certainty, but Elizabeth kept her own counsel,
and when Nathan brought Jack at noon she did not
speak of her husband&#8217;s absence. The second day the
hired men began to make mention of it, and the evening
of the third day Luther Hansen appeared at the sitting-room
door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_527' name='page_527'></a>527</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, what&#8217;s this I hear about Hunter?&#8221; he asked,
looking searchingly into her face.</p>
<p>Elizabeth told him all that she knew, except the unjust
thing he had said about Luther.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about his plans,&#8221; she concluded,
&#8220;except that he said he meant to go to his mother
after he had marketed the cattle. You&#8217;ll hear from the
neighbours that Hugh&#8217;s money has set me up and made a
fool of me, and various other things,&#8221; she added; and she
saw in his face that it had already been said.</p>
<p>The girl sat and looked into the night through the open
door for a moment and then went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go to Colebyville to-morrow, and see Doctor
Morgan and look after business matters. I&#8217;ll tell you
what we decide upon when I get home. There&#8217;ll have to
be a real division of the property now. I don&#8217;t know what
to do about living here alone. I suppose there&#8217;ll be every
kind of gossip?&#8221;</p>
<p>The last part of the sentence was a question, and one
Luther was not the man to evade.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a lot of talk that hain&#8217;t got no truth in it
to meet,&#8221; he said reluctantly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have t&#8217; have some
one with you here. You couldn&#8217;t git Hornby, could
you?&#8221; Luther knew the nature of the gossip the neighbours
would wreak upon her.</p>
<p>A light fell upon Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very idea!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Just what I need
to do and at the same time just what I would love to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther was delighted that that important feature of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_528' name='page_528'></a>528</span>
matter could be so easily arranged. He could not bear to
have her mixed up with any sort of scandal, when her
neighbours so little understood the real situation, and
would be so ready to strike her wherever they could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you go an&#8217; see Hornby to-night, Lizzie. Have
Jake hitch up for you, an&#8217; take Hepsie along.&#8221; Luther
paused a moment and then proceeded on another phase of
her troubles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie, how do you feel about it? Do you&mdash;would
you like t&#8217; have &#8217;im back? &#8217;Cause if you would, I&#8217;ll go to
Mitchell County for you. You ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; have no
easy time of it here. Folks&mdash;specially th&#8217; women&#8217;s&mdash;goin&#8217;
t&#8217; have it in for you quite a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Elizabeth answered promptly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take whatever
comes from my neighbours. I can shut my doors and
keep them outside, but, Luther, I can&#8217;t go on as things
have been on the inside of my own house. I don&#8217;t want to
talk about it at all, even to you, but I shall let him go. It&#8217;s
better than some other things. We&#8217;d simply come to the
place where we had to understand each other. I&#8217;d a
great deal rather have him back than to have him gone,
but he wouldn&#8217;t understand at all if I sent for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther looked at her approvingly and yet something in
him held back. He longed to spare her all the low tittle-tattle
of her neighbours, the coarse jests of the hired men
among themselves, and the eternal suspicions of the
women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all you would say, Luther,&#8221; she said, understanding
his reluctance to give up. &#8220;I know what these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_529' name='page_529'></a>529</span>
women who think I haven&#8217;t wanted to visit them will say,
and I don&#8217;t blame them, but I will not send for him now
or ever. I have wronged him in ways he has known nothing
of&mdash;maybe the scandal I haven&#8217;t deserved at his
hands will square that deal a little&mdash;but that is not the
present difficulty. We&#8217;ll have to have an agreement
about our plan of life together. If he ever comes back I
shall never deceive him again, but I will never be deceived
by him again, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know best, Lizzie. I&#8217;ll talk to Jake for
you. You&#8217;d best try t&#8217; keep him an&#8217; Hepsie. They&#8217;re
good friends an&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; need friends.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Luther saw that the buggy was got ready for Elizabeth
and Hepsie, and after they had gone talked to the men,
telling them that Elizabeth had asked him to do so. He
told them her offer was for them to stay on at the usual
wage, or go now so that she could fill their places. After
they had signified their willingness to remain in her
employment, he took Jake aside and had a long talk with
him.</p>
<p>Jake Ransom filled with anger when the two were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything when you was a talkin&#8217; t&#8217; them
men,&#8221; he said confidentially, &#8220;but I ain&#8217;t lived in this
house for close on three year now without learnin&#8217; somethin&#8217;.
Damned fool! never done nothin&#8217; she&#8217;s wanted &#8217;im
to since I&#8217;ve been here. She got &#8217;er eye-teeth cut when
Mis Hornby died, but it most killed &#8217;er. I&#8217;ve watched
&#8217;er a gittin&#8217; hold of &#8217;erself gradual-like, an&#8217; I knew there&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_530' name='page_530'></a>530</span>
be an end of his bossin&#8217; some day. Gosh! I&#8217;m glad she
got th&#8217; money! Noland was some fond of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jake stole a sidelong glance at Luther as he said it and
waited to see if he would elicit an answer. When Luther
did not reply, he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dog&#8217;on glad I&#8217;ve been here. Lots of folks &#8217;ll ask
me questions, an&#8217; won&#8217;t I be innocent? You kin help at
your end of this thing too. I guess we kin do it &#8217;tween
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The understanding was perfect, but Jake took warning
by Luther&#8217;s refusal to discuss private affairs. Without
saying just what was intended, each knew what course of
action the other meant to take, and so Elizabeth was
granted friends at the critical moment of her life and
spared much that was hard in a community where personalities
were the only topics of conversation.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Nathan Hornby was only too glad to live in the house
with Jack Hunter. As he remarked, it would take no
more time to drive over to his work than to cook his own
breakfast in the morning.</p>
<p>Hepsie was at this time Elizabeth&#8217;s principal defender.
While listening to the reading of the will on the day of
the funeral, Hepsie, old in the ways of her little world, had
known that some explanation would have to be made of so
unusual a matter as a man leaving his money to another
man&#8217;s wife, instead of to the man himself, and had begun
by giving out the report which she intended the world to
accept, by talking to Sadie Hansen before she got out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_531' name='page_531'></a>531</span>
of the dooryard. Hepsie knew that first reports went
farthest with country folk, and Luther, who understood
better than any one else why the money had been left to
Elizabeth, was inwardly amused at Sadie&#8217;s explanations
afterward.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Luther,&#8221; Sadie had said on the way home
that day, &#8220;Mr. Noland told Hepsie he was agoin&#8217; t&#8217; leave
his share of th&#8217; land to Lizzie, &#8217;cause Doc Morgan says
She&#8217;ll never be strong again after overworkin&#8217; for all them
men, an&#8217; things. An&#8217; she says he felt awful bad &#8217;cause he
was a layin&#8217; there sick so long an&#8217; her a havin&#8217; t&#8217; do for
&#8217;im when she wasn&#8217;t able&mdash;an&#8217; do you know, she thinks
that&#8217;s why he killed hisself? I always did like &#8217;im. I
think it was mighty nice for him t&#8217; leave &#8217;er th&#8217; stuff.
My! think of a woman havin&#8217; a farm all &#8217;er own!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Luther Hansen listened to Sadie telling her mother
the same thing the next day, and smiled again, for Mrs.
Crane could talk much, and was to talk to better purpose
than she knew.</p>
<p>Also, when Elizabeth went to the little schoolhouse to
meeting the first Sunday of her widowhood, being determined
to be a part of the community in which she lived,
Hepsie was on the outskirts of the little crowd after
services were over, to explain in a whisper that Lizzie was
&#8220;goin&#8217; t&#8217; go t&#8217; meetin&#8217; now like she&#8217;d always wanted to do,
only Mr. Hunter never &#8217;d take &#8217;er anywhere &#8217;cause &#8217;e felt
hisself too good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepsie was to fight Elizabeth&#8217;s battles on many occasions
and stayed on, watchful as a hawk of Elizabeth&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_532' name='page_532'></a>532</span>
reputation. A sly joke among the hired men while discussing
their position in the house of &#8220;the grass-widder&#8221;
drove Hepsie beside herself and made her even more ready
than she had been at first to serve the interests of one who
was to have no easy time among her jealous neighbours.
Elizabeth knew that in that hour she could have had most
of these people for her friends had it not been that she was
supposed to be &#8220;stuck-up.&#8221; This also was a price she
was to pay for having let her husband dominate her.</p>
<p>When Doctor Morgan was told of Elizabeth&#8217;s plan to
farm the place herself he was delighted and approved of
it heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little brick, Mrs. Hunter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
back you in anything you decide to do. It was devilish
mean to run off without settling affairs up. If any of these
yahoos around here say anything about it they&#8217;ll get a
setting up from me that they won&#8217;t want again. But I&#8217;m
mighty glad you&#8217;ve got Hornby. That&#8217;ll keep actual
slander off of you. How much did you say you owed
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred&mdash;and some expenses for Mr. Noland&mdash;besides
the note you hold for the team. I&#8217;ve got about
a hundred in the bank, but I shall need a pony to ride
about the farm, and that will take about half of what I
have ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pony&#8217;s a good idea. There&#8217;s no telling what
would be made out of you wandering around the fields on
foot to look after the hired men, but on horseback you&#8217;d
be all right. Now don&#8217;t you worry about that note of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_533' name='page_533'></a>533</span>
mine&mdash;I&#8217;m in no hurry,&#8221; the doctor said encouragingly.
Elizabeth saw the advantage of having Doctor Morgan as
an enthusiastic advocate of her plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the land, Doctor?&#8221; the girl asked next.
&#8220;I want a legal division as soon as possible. Will it have
to be appraised and sold?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Morgan noted joyfully that Elizabeth Hunter
had her business well in mind, and assured her that it
would be only a formality to have the appraising done, as
she could buy it in herself, and further assured her that he
would himself confer with John after all was settled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE WEIGHT OF A DOLLAREE AND OUT OF DEBT DON&#8217;T FORGET THAT&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Nathan Hornby moved promptly over to the
Hunter farm, and established himself in Hugh&#8217;s
old room upstairs.</p>
<p>The farm work prospered under Elizabeth&#8217;s management.
She was fortunate enough to trade a young heifer
with a calf at her side for Silas&#8217;s pony, and because feed
was scarce she sold most of the stock, keeping only such
as she desired to open farming with the next spring. The
hogs were marketed early, and the few steers left when
the cattle had been taken to Mitchell County were sold
to the first buyer who offered a reasonable figure for them;
the cows which gave evidence of increase were kept and
the rest sold. Altogether money enough was raised to
pay the note for the team and all the outstanding indebtedness
except the note for five hundred dollars. The
latter did not mature till May and could stand. The
expense of feeding discouraged the farmers and prices
dropped steadily all winter.</p>
<p>When April came the Johnson land was sold to a
stranger, who came and offered to buy the west eighty of
Elizabeth&#8217;s land. The five hundred would be due the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_535' name='page_535'></a>535</span>
next month. The new neighbour coveted that eighty,
and Elizabeth decided that if she could get a price
warranting its sale she would sell, pay off the five hundred,
and put the rest into calves while they were cheap.
She offered the land for thirty-five dollars an acre. It was
unheard of! No one had ever asked so much for land in
that country, but the man wanted to add that land to his
farm, and after some bargaining paid the price.</p>
<p>Frugal and cautious, Elizabeth paid the five hundred
with the first check she drew against the price of the land.
That left two thousand for calves and three hundred for
running expenses. John had taken one horse out of the
new team when he went away, and Elizabeth decided not
to buy another, but to hire a horse in harvesting time.
There were three full teams for the plows, besides the
horse which had been hurt in the runaway. It had
recovered and, though scarred and stiffened, could be used
for ordinary work. She took good care to have it hitched
beside a solid, trusty mate and treated gently to soothe its
wild nature.</p>
<p>No word had come from John except when Doctor
Morgan wrote him of the appraisement of the land.
Then a curt letter had been received saying that whatever
they did would be satisfactory to him and that when
the deeds came he would sign them. Not to be outdone,
Elizabeth bought the portion of land which did not have
the house and buildings, agreeing to rent the home eighty
until such time as he should choose to sell it, and expressing
a desire, since Jack had been born there, to buy the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_536' name='page_536'></a>536</span>
home if John should ever wish to part with it. To his
suggestion that she use the home without rent&mdash;in fact,
an offer of it as his share of support of the child&mdash;Elizabeth
refused to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll rent it of him as I would of anybody, Doctor,&#8221; she
had replied, and made out a note on the spot.</p>
<p>John had written that he was in the commission business
in Chicago, and did not say whether his mother was
with him nor not. To Elizabeth he did not write, but to
Jack he sent loads of toys and a sled at Christmas time.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had not attempted to communicate with
John direct, but had rented his share of the land from him
through Doctor Morgan. The sale of the west eighty
gave her enough money to stock the place with every
animal it would hold. When the girl began to look about
her for calves, she found that because of the price of corn
many farmers were selling their hogs at a sacrifice. Hogs
were quick money. She invested in such as were ready
for increase, and by harvest time there was a fine lot of
pigs on the Hunter farm. Every cow had been milked,
and the calves raised by hand so as to have the milk for
the young pigs till the early corn could be gathered.
Milking was hard work, but Elizabeth Hunter&#8217;s pride
was up.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s pride had had some sore pricks. In spite of
every effort to avoid hearing the small talk regarding herself,
Elizabeth had been obliged to listen to such portions
as dribbled through from her mother, and an occasional
remark from Sadie Hansen. Sadie Hansen&#8217;s life was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_537' name='page_537'></a>537</span>
reorganized one, but there were small lapses, and from
force of habit she repeated things, though she was in the
main about the kindest neighbour Elizabeth had. With
Mrs. Farnshaw the case was different. She was Elizabeth&#8217;s
mother, and certain privileges must be accorded
her because of the relationship. When she chose to disapprove
of the separation of her daughter from her husband,
the daughter was compelled to recognize her right to
protest, and often inadvertently to listen to the gossip
which her mother urged as reasons for her objections.
Mrs. Farnshaw came often and talked volubly. Elizabeth
shielded herself as best she could from her mother&#8217;s
prattlings, but had to endure many tearful complaints,
for her mother was suffering much loneliness and discomfort
since her daughter&#8217;s marriage. Josiah Farnshaw did
not forget, nor let his wife forget, the disaffection of
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Once when Mrs. Farnshaw had gone beyond the mark
where her daughter could receive it in silence, urging that
Elizabeth call her husband home and submit herself to
the matrimonial yoke, the girl turned upon her in annoyance:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have me just where you are yourself, ma.
You say pa mistreats you&mdash;that&#8217;s just what was coming
to me. If I didn&#8217;t have money enough that was all my
own to live on, my husband would be sneering at me and
keeping me in hot water all the time, exactly as pa sneers
at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re separated!&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_538' name='page_538'></a>538</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl said slowly, &#8220;and because we are separated
I can go to town if I like, I can go to church, I can go
to see a neighbour, or my mother, without hating to ask
for a horse to drive or being told when to come home, and
when Jack is naughty I can talk to him without having
anybody set his little will against mine and make it harder
to deal with him. Oh, mother mine! Can&#8217;t you see that
I&#8217;m happier than you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you&#8217;re livin&#8217; apart and&mdash;and folks is a talkin&#8217;!&#8221;
the mother exclaimed hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them talk. Their talk don&#8217;t hurt me, and it
shouldn&#8217;t hurt you. They don&#8217;t talk before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they talk behind your back, Lizzie,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw
said with a wise nod of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;They talked about us when John was here, ma, and
they always talk about us; it doesn&#8217;t matter much what
they talk about; they wouldn&#8217;t pay off the mortgage, nor
the interest, nor raise Jack right, nor give me a chance to
rest on washday. Some will say I was in the wrong, some
that John was, and they all said that I was stuck-up and
wouldn&#8217;t visit with them when it wasn&#8217;t so at all. They
are looking to see <i>who</i> was wrong; I have reasoned out
<i>what</i> was wrong. It&#8217;s principles, not personalities, that
get people into troubles that don&#8217;t seem to have any way
out. Oh! can&#8217;t you see, ma, that I&#8217;m free, and the women
that talk about me are just where they&#8217;ve always
been. Free! and don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;m out of debt.
That&#8217;s more than you&#8217;ve got by staying with your
husband, and you haven&#8217;t been able to keep people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_539' name='page_539'></a>539</span>
from talking after all. Free, and out of debt! Don&#8217;t
forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been free, either, if Mr. Noland
hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; left you th&#8217; money,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw replied.</p>
<p>Elizabeth dropped into a retrospective mood for a
moment before she answered, and then said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that. God in Heaven, how well I know it!
And do you know I think about it every day&mdash;what
could be done for the poor women on these hot Kansas
prairies if there were some way to see that every girl that
loves a man enough to marry him could have money
enough to keep her if she couldn&#8217;t live under the work
and children he crowds on her. I&#8217;m free, because I have
money enough all my own to live on. That&#8217;s the weight
of a dollar. Don&#8217;t forget that, you poor ma, who have
never had a dollar except what has been doled out to you
by the man you married. The weight of a dollar,&#8221;
Elizabeth added meditatively, &#8220;that&#8217;s what it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw, who had bought the groceries for her
little family with the butter and eggs, and whose sugar
had sometimes been short because there was a supply of
Horse Shoe Plug to provide also, had no answer ready.</p>

</div>

<p>Two years of favourable weather and good fortune
with her livestock saw the money Elizabeth had
invested in hogs doubled and trebled, and later,
when the Johnson land was again offered for sale, she was
able to buy it for cash and have the place well stocked
after it was done. Silas Chamberlain, who watched
Elizabeth with the same fatherly interest he had felt when
her child was born, and who glowed with secret pride at
the way in which she had won her way back into the
country society about them, came in often and offered
his measure of good-natured praise. He had prophesied
the first time she had cooked for harvest hands that she
would become a famous cook, but he had not expected to
find her a famous farmer. What was still more astonishing
to the old man was that she had become noted in quite
other ways. The move she had made in going to meeting
the first Sunday after John&#8217;s departure, and Hepsie&#8217;s
explanation of it, had worked to her advantage in reestablishing
her in the community as one of its factors,
and opened to her the opportunity to wield the influence
which Luther had pointed out to her the best educated
woman in a community should wield. She took a class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_541' name='page_541'></a>541</span>
in the little Sunday school at the schoolhouse, not so much
because she was an enthusiastic churchwoman as because
it was the place where contact could be had. Elizabeth
belonged to no church, but Elizabeth could turn the conversation
of the church members, among whom she
mingled, from gossip to better things, and there was not a
quilting bee nor an aid society meeting in the country
around to which she was not invited, and which she did
not raise to a higher standard by her presence.</p>
<p>The snubs which the neighbour women were at first
anxious to deliver fell flat in the quiet unconsciousness
with which they were met. Elizabeth felt that much of
the treatment she received was given in righteous indignation,
and pursued the policy when possible to do so of
not seeing it, and when it must be met to meet it with perfect
good humour. She kept her credit good among the
men with whom she bartered for young stock, and there
began to creep in a better feeling for her within the first six
months after she assumed the care of the farm and the
problematical position of a &#8220;grass widow&#8221; in the neighborhood.
Doctor Morgan, Hepsie, Jake, and Luther
were splendid assets in the race with public feeling, and
Silas saw his young neighbour&#8217;s affairs straighten out with
chuckles of delight. He watched her man&oelig;uvre with her
business deals and saw the cool-headedness of them with
growing enthusiasm. He passed Nathan on his way to
the field one spring morning and noticed that Nathan was
using a seeder from the Hunter farm. It was bright with
a coat of freshly dried paint.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_542' name='page_542'></a>542</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she borrowed my brushes for last week,&#8221;
he exclaimed to Nathan. &#8220;Ever see anything like &#8217;er?&#8221;
he asked admiringly. &#8220;Takes care of everything. Did
you ever see th&#8217; likes of them hogs? She&#8217;s made more
money sellin&#8217; that land an&#8217; buyin&#8217; of it back &#8217;n most of us
old heads &#8217;ll make in five year. Everything she touches
seems t&#8217; have a wad stuck under it somewheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was more than merely successful in money
matters; she was a reorganized woman from the standpoint
of health also. She was no more the weary, harassed
woman who had churned, baked, and cooked for shellers,
and had so nearly found an early grave. The satisfaction
of working unrestrained, of resting when nature and
woman&#8217;s constitution demanded, and the whole matter of
living without fear, had given her a sound and healthy
body and a mind broader and less liable to emotional bias.
The principle which she had demanded from her husband
in their last conversation she put into practice. Hepsie
ruled the house very much as if it were her own. Elizabeth
knew from experience the dreariness of housework
where all individuality is denied the worker. Hepsie
came and went as the exigencies of the work permitted,
and there was always a horse provided for her journeys
away from the place; in fact, Hepsie was much more free
than her mistress had been in her first three years in the
same house. Elizabeth demanded good service, but she
gave good service also, and from being a good joke to
work for the grass widow, it came to be recognized that
the Hunter farm was a good place to live, and when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_543' name='page_543'></a>543</span>
spring came around the men who had worked there the
season before always presented themselves for fresh
hiring.</p>
<p>Two years more passed, and Master Jack Hunter was
seven years old. On his seventh birthday his mother
dressed him and herself carefully and rode over to the
lonely graveyard. She did not go flower-laden. Rather,
she went as was her custom, to spend an hour with the
quiet dead in silent thought. Hugh Noland&#8217;s sacrifice
had not been in vain. The life he had laid down had,
whatever its mistakes and weaknesses, been a happy one
to himself, and had carried a ray of cheer to all with whom
it had come in contact, while his death had pointed
toward an ideal of purity, in spite of failures. That brief
period during which Elizabeth had been compelled to live
a double life for his sake had held many lessons, and had
forever weaned her from duplicity of any sort. Those
special hours&mdash;the hours spent beside Hugh Noland&#8217;s
grave&mdash;were spent in searching self-inquiry, in casting
up accounts, in measuring herself against the principles
with which she struggled. People had gone out of her
wrestlings; principles remained. Here Elizabeth meditated
upon the fact that because the neighbourhood
sentiment and discussion centred around their home, she
and John Hunter had missed a golden opportunity in not
having become a force for good during those first years
of their marriage.</p>
<p>The hour spent beside Hugh&#8217;s grave was her sacrament.
There she went to renew her faith in her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_544' name='page_544'></a>544</span>
powers, which Hugh&#8217;s interest and estimates had first
taught her to recognize; there she went to renew her vows
of higher living, and there to contemplate the freedom
which Hugh Noland had given her. But for the land and
stock which gave her an independent income she would
have been as tearful, worn, and despondent as many of
the women about her. Her heart was very tender toward
Hugh as she sat beside his grave to-day. She held his
letter&mdash;the only one he had ever written, her&mdash;in her
hands. As she read it over, part of its last sentence,
&#8220;and will, I hope, help toward emancipating you from
care,&#8221; struck her attention, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, mamma? What hurts?&#8221; Jack asked,
always quick to respond to his mother&#8217;s moods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, dear, but Uncle Hugh&#8217;s letter. He wrote it
just before he died. He was very kind to me,&#8221; she said,
patting the face thrust up for a kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was&mdash;was my papa here then?&#8221; the child asked,
curious about the life he could not remember, and trying
to relate things as he heard of them in their true relation
to the father who was a mysterious personage and
therefore interesting.</p>
<p>When his mother did not answer, he crept closer and,
laying his head against her arm, said wistfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, will my papa ever come back to us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Jack,&#8221; she answered quietly. &#8220;Perhaps.
If he don&#8217;t, you shall go and see him when you
are a big boy. Now run away, and leave mamma a
chance to think for a whole ten minutes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_545' name='page_545'></a>545</span></p>
<p>The child ran off to the horses, and Elizabeth faced the
life she led. A curious thing was made plain to her in that
hour&mdash;namely, that Hugh, whom she remembered tenderly,
was but a memory, while John Hunter, the father
of her child, whom she had no other cause to love, was a
living force in her life, and that at the child&#8217;s simple question
a longing flamed up, and a feeling that she wished he
were there. She remembered him as he would ride with
his hat in his hand, his fair, soft hair wind-blown about his
temples, and she would have been glad to go forth to meet
him and try anew to build a life together which would be
livable to both.</p>
<p>A long time she pondered, and the impulse to write to
him came over her, but that impulse was followed by
retrospection, and as one thing after another arose out of
the past in solemn procession, closing with the unloved
and unwished-for child which she had lost five years ago,
she knew that she would not open a correspondence. At
that point, and with the memory of the sweltering day and
the unnecessary churning, her tender memory of Hugh,
who had made her free and economically independent,
welled up in her in one glad tide of thanksgiving, and she
thought of her mother and the thousands of other women
on these Kansas prairies who had not been saved from
such a fate by being made independent landowners, and
she pondered on their fate till she longed for a way out for
all women who were mothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This income could have set John free too, if he would
only have thought it over,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_546' name='page_546'></a>546</span>
need not have been burdened with us while he was getting
his depths in the business world,&#8221; she concluded.</p>
<p>Wherever Elizabeth&#8217;s thoughts turned to-day, John was
the centre of them. Elizabeth had never been resentful
toward her husband, and the never-ceasing cause of speculation
and comment in the neighbourhood had been upon
the fact that though she lived apart from him, she never
seemed to think of divorce. Elizabeth&#8217;s attitude toward
John was that of a mother who waits for a child to find the
real light on a situation. She rarely heard from him, and
never directly. She knew of some of his affairs through
Doctor Morgan, with whom John corresponded when
business required, but she wrote regularly to Mrs. Hunter,
who had gone to her son the second year he had been
away, and who had written to her at that time. Elizabeth
had been glad of so simple a means of keeping the link
unbroken between him and his child. It had been no part
of her plan to separate Jack from his father. She would
not ask John to return, but she wished him to have such
knowledge of his son as his temper would permit. She
wrote such details of the home and the child as would
interest them, knowing that John would read the letters.
Somehow, to-day she wished that she could write to him
direct, but as she thought she shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be,&#8221; she said aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, if you don&#8217;t come we won&#8217;t have time to go
for the mail,&#8221; Jack called.</p>
<p>The pleasant afternoon had waned; Elizabeth Hunter
gazed about her in astonishment; it was indeed late.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_547' name='page_547'></a>547</span></p>
<p>She stooped and passed her hand over the name cut in the
marble slab. &#8220;Hugh Noland, aged twenty-nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hugh Noland, dear,&#8221; she said aloud, &#8220;you have set
me financially free, but there is another kind of freedom
I have got to win for myself. I&#8217;ve got to tell John the
things that we wanted to tell and were too cowardly to
do. If we ever come together again I shall tell it out, if
all this country gets to hear it. Jack can better afford to
take the disgrace of it than to have a mother who carries
it about with her as a secret. Without honesty no other
virtue is a virtue at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes were full of tears as she voiced her vow,
but there was a sense of relief welling up within her that
she had not known in all the five years Hugh had lain here.
She stood very quiet till her emotions were under control
and her sunny self in command again, then she blew a kiss
at Aunt Susan&#8217;s grave and went to the waiting child and
with him rode a merry race toward Colebyville.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>TO DO OVER, AND TO DO BETTER, WAS THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED</h3>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth Hunter and her son were still
breathing hard from rapid riding when they drew
up in front of the post-office. Elizabeth dropped
from the saddle, tossing her rein to Jack to hold till her
return, and went inside. She was to remember this day
and the dingy little window through which mail was
passed. The postmaster was a new man and tossed the
letters out carelessly; therefore he did not see the sudden
start the girl gave as she began to gather them up.</p>
<p>John Hunter&#8217;s familiar handwriting stared at her from
the top envelope.</p>
<p>Elizabeth thought of many things while she waited for
the man to run through the newspapers and magazines.
Half an hour ago she had registered a vow beside Hugh
Noland&#8217;s grave. She was to be tested promptly. When
all was handed out to her, she took the pile&mdash;Elizabeth&#8217;s
magazines supplied the entire community with reading
material, and were handed from house to house till as
ragged as the tumble weeds of her native Kansas&mdash;and
put them all in the canvas bag at Jack&#8217;s saddle horn. The
letter was unopened. Something made her wait.
Something said that John was asking to return&mdash;to do over,
and to do better, was the opportunity offered to her.
Her vow rose up before her; without the fulfillment of that
vow there could be no <i>better</i>, that she recognized&mdash;and
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

&#8220;JOHN HUNTER&#8217;S FAMILIAR HANDWRITING STARED AT HER FROM THE TOP ENVELOPE&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_549' name='page_549'></a>549</span></div>
<p>All through the long ride home she pondered upon the
past and upon the possibilities of the future. Not till
after Jack was safely tucked away in his bed, not till
Hepsie had her supper work done and had gone upstairs
and all the various members of her household had retired
for the night, and she was certain of hours for uninterrupted
thinking, did Elizabeth Hunter bring out the unopened
letter and lay it on the table before her. Even
then she renewed her vow before she broke the seal. Was
he the old John, who would fly out impulsively and cover
them all with disgrace if she told him? she asked herself
many times. In a cold sweat of terror, she asked herself
also if it were possible to build right in this new endeavour
without telling John of the love which she had shown to
Hugh; the temptation was terrible, but she was compelled
to shake her head. The habit of openness and fair dealing
would not hold her excused; there was no other way,
she must tell it out. Carefully she went over all the
things that would be lost if this story should be bruited
abroad. Jack would be disgraced, she would be stripped
of her influence in the neighbourhood, slain in the sight of
her friends who had fought her battles for her because they
believed in her, stripped of everything which had gone to
make life worth the living, and she would place herself in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_550' name='page_550'></a>550</span>
the power of a man whose only attitude toward the story
might be one of self-righteous justification. Was it worth
the price? Her own words rose up before her, &#8220;Without
honesty no other virtue is a virtue at all.&#8221; Elizabeth
pondered a long time, and again her own words rose up to
confront her, &#8220;It does not matter <i>who</i> is wrong, the thing
that matters is <i>what</i> is wrong,&#8221; and for Elizabeth there was
no escape. This had been the philosophy of her life; she
was called upon to stand or fall on that ground. With
her head bowed in acknowledgment, she drew the missive
out of its envelope and began to read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Dear Elizabeth: This letter will no doubt surprise you, but I couldn&#8217;t wait any
longer. I might begin by saying that I was homesick for Jack&mdash;which is true&mdash;but
I&#8217;m going to confess that I&#8217;m homesick for you too. Is there still hope? I would
have written you long ago, but I went into things too heavy and lost the money I got
for the cattle&mdash;and then I couldn&#8217;t. It would have looked like asking to come back
to the land. As you know, I mortgaged the home eighty&mdash;it hurt some to do that,
knowing you&#8217;d have to sign it&mdash;and began slower. I got along very well, but it was
terribly tedious, and at last, after three years of steady work, and no debts, I couldn&#8217;t
wait any longer, and put half of what I had on the Board of Trade proceedings. <i>I won!</i>
Last Saturday I sold all I had, and now while I can come to you right, I want to ask if
you will take me? Take me quick, if you are going to, before I do some reckless thing
and lose it again. I hear you have prospered; that was why I had to wait so long. I
often think of dear old Hugh, and his interest in some of the things about the neighbourhood,
and I have been given to see while living in this rotten hole of a city how much I
underestimated the people about us in Kansas. I would be glad to come back and live
among them. Will you let me? A telegram will bring me to you on the next train.</p>
<p>With love to both you and Jack, who will be seven years old this week,</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>Affectionately,</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>John.</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>The tension was broken. Elizabeth laid the letter back
with a smile. How like John to suggest a telegram!
John never could wait. How well she knew his little
weaknesses; the written characters of the missive had the
flowing curves of haste in their running letters. He had
written on the impulse of the moment, no matter how long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_551' name='page_551'></a>551</span>
the desire had been in his heart. The very spontaneity
of the confession was unpremeditated and worked in John
Hunter&#8217;s favour. He had remembered Jack&#8217;s birthday
too! That day seven years ago rose up in Elizabeth&#8217;s
memory to plead for Jack&#8217;s father. She earnestly desired
John&#8217;s presence, and yet&mdash;could it be done?</p>
<p>Far into the night Elizabeth Hunter sat with the letter
before her, reading and rereading it, pondering upon the
possibilities of the future, seeing them in the light of the
past she had spent with him, wondering what sort of man
her husband had become in the five years since she had
seen him. The letter sounded as if those years might
have been profitable ones. There was both the openness
of real honesty and the reserve of real strength in the confession
about his financial affairs. The most hopeful
thing she found in the letter was the sentence about
Hugh&#8217;s estimate of the neighbours among whom they
had lived and the implied comparison regarding the city
in which he now did business. Dear old John! Had
Chicago business men tried the methods on him that he
had thought it fair to apply to his dealings with her? In
the midst of that question rose the one&mdash;would John
Hunter feel the same toward Hugh Noland&#8217;s estimates
when he was told the truth about his wife&#8217;s affection for
Hugh, and of the weakness of both in the demonstrations
of that affection? Well, it had to be told. Scandal
would be hard to face with no denial possible. Doctor
Morgan had known it all and still trusted her; likewise
Luther; but Hepsie, and Jake, and Sadie? Besides, Jack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_552' name='page_552'></a>552</span>
would have to know, and would suffer for things of which
he was innocent! The girl wrestled with the subject till
midnight, and long after. At last, to put it where she
could not deceive herself, she wrote a simple statement of
the whole thing and sealed it up with John&#8217;s address upon
the envelope, and then raising her hand solemnly promised
herself that this letter which contained the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth should be mailed
as she had written it without being opened to change a
word. She would answer John&#8217;s letter in one apart from
this and send it by the same mail, but this letter she would
send as it stood.</p>
<p>As she got up to go to bed, she picked up the bag in
which they brought the mail and felt in it to see if anything
were left. A small narrow book that opened endwise
and had the name of the Bank of Colebyville on it
was all. It was a fitting end to her considerations. She
had never owned a checkbook till recent years. Because
of its presence, she might yet be able to answer John
Hunter as he wished. She thought long on her situation.
There was no sleep in her. The larger, the universal,
aspects of the question began to crowd in upon
her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no other way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A woman,
to be free, must have money of her own. She must not be
supported by a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped out on the porch and stood looking toward
the east. The refreshing breeze which had sprung up
cooled and invigorated her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_553' name='page_553'></a>553</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The wind before the dawn! The beginning of a new
day!&#8221; she said aloud.</p>
<p>Turning toward the kitchen, she began to pack a box
which stood waiting on the end of the kitchen table.
Doughnuts, cookies and pies had been left there to cool
the evening before. Mrs. Farnshaw was to have threshers
to cook for to-day, and Elizabeth had grown thoughtful
of the mother, who was aging visibly. In such ways as
she could, she spared her mother&#8217;s strength and gave her
the comfort of frequent visits and companionship. In
order to get the long eight-mile drive over before it became
hot, it was necessary to get an early start, and
Elizabeth, with Jack at her side, was on the road before
the sun was fairly above the horizon.</p>
<p>About eight o&#8217;clock Mrs. Farnshaw turned at the sound
of their feet on her doorstep. She set her cob basket on
the floor, put the stove lid over the roaring fire, and turned
to Jack with grandmotherly delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a real comfort, Lizzie,&#8221; she said, straightening
up with Jack in her arms. &#8220;I never used t&#8217; think you
would be, but you are. I&#8217;m that tired that I&#8217;m ready
t&#8217; drop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything more than usual?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, noting
the fagged and heavy face, and the gathering tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothin&#8217; more &#8217;n &#8217;as happened many a time; only
&#8217;e grows crosser, seems to me, as &#8217;e grows older. He was
particular bad last night, and I didn&#8217;t sleep none. It&#8217;s
awful hot weather t&#8217; lay awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Elizabeth did not reply, the mother said testily:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_554' name='page_554'></a>554</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now I s&#8217;pose You&#8217;ll be thinkin&#8217; that you don&#8217;t have
t&#8217; care for what a man says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed, but not in her usual merry way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;I was thinking farther
than that&mdash;I was wondering&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused to think
and then broke out suddenly. &#8220;John&#8217;s written to ask if
he can come back, and I was just wondering&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnshaw was all animation at once, her own
troubles forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Now look here,
Lizzie, you&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; let him come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had told her mother on the impulse of the
moment after withholding the news from Nathan and even
from Jack. The child had been wriggling out of his grandmother&#8217;s
arms and had not heard what his mother said.
Elizabeth waited till he was out of hearing. She half
regretted having mentioned it. She was going to have to
argue out her decision with her mother, and she had made
no decision.</p>
<p>The mother&#8217;s accidental remark had produced the
impulse to tell. Well, it was all right. It might be that
she could decide better after discussing it with some one.
Elizabeth looked at her mother doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, ma. I may. It&#8217;s all owing to whether
we can agree on the terms of starting over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; lay down rules t&#8217; him?&#8221; the mother
cried in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s my time to find out what rules he&#8217;s going to lay
down to me at least,&#8221; Elizabeth said dryly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_555' name='page_555'></a>555</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I never heard of such a thing! Say, don&#8217;t you
love &#8217;im any more, Lizzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I do, ma,&#8221; Elizabeth said slowly. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s the very trouble with women. They think they
ought to love a man enough to take him without a definite
understanding, and then they find that a woman&#8217;s love
means mostly obedience to a man. Yes, I think I love
him. But I&#8217;m going to know what he expects, and I&#8217;m
going to tell him what I expect, and make no mistakes this
time. We&#8217;ll know before we begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he may not take you,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw said in a
frightened whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think I&#8217;m taking him,&#8221; Elizabeth said, beginning
to unload the box of provisions she had brought.
&#8220;You forget that I&#8217;m making my own living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That <i>does</i> make a difference,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes <i>all</i> the difference,&#8221; Elizabeth replied
positively. &#8220;The longer I look at it the more convinced
I am that the whole thing hinges right on that point. If
we live together again I&#8217;ll know that it isn&#8217;t because he
feels that having married me he must keep me in food and
clothes, and he&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s because I want to and not
because I&#8217;ve got a child to be supported. I believe I love
him; but if I didn&#8217;t know I could leave him in a minute
if he made me do things that I wasn&#8217;t able to do I wouldn&#8217;t
dare to say yes. Knowing that I don&#8217;t have to live with
him if he begins to order me around, I think I&#8217;ll try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer girl, Lizzie,&#8221; the mother said, puzzled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_556' name='page_556'></a>556</span>
and uncertain what to think of the philosophy she propounded.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to be afraid of men at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to be, ma, because no man will ever again
pay for my food and clothes. You are not to tell anybody,
even the boys. I may not do it yet. I didn&#8217;t intend to
tell you for a while, but you insisted on telling me what
I was thinking about, and it popped right out at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave her mother a tender look and added:
&#8220;I told you first when he asked me before,&#8221; which was
a thing her mother could understand and appreciate.
Elizabeth was considerate of the little mother whose life
was hard, and who was afraid of a man.</p>
<p>At that point Elizabeth fell into a brown study. She
argued for her own rights, knowing that only on that
path could peace come to either herself or John, but she
did not feel herself wholly worthy, and John wholly
unworthy; she knew her weaknesses, and she knew she
had wronged John Hunter as well as he had wronged her;
she was willing to take him if he would be as willing to
correct his faults and confess them as she was willing to
do. She did not ask of John Hunter that he be always
right in his actions toward her, but that he discuss their
grievances and let them look together for better ways of
settling what was right for each. She was so deep in her
own thoughts that she did not hear Jack, who called to her
from the door:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, let&#8217;s go! Come on! They&#8217;re going right
now, mamma!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_557' name='page_557'></a>557</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth did not hear the child till he tugged at her
skirts and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, mamma! Grandma won&#8217;t care. Come
on!&#8221;</p>
<p>His mother looked down at the boy with a smile.
How well she remembered the delights of threshing-day
herself. She looked about the kitchen to see what had
yet to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a little, Jack. I&#8217;ve got to help get the table set
and the dinner on to cook. You wouldn&#8217;t have me leave
grandma to do all the work alone, would you?&#8221; she asked
suggestively.</p>
<p>As Jack hesitated between his great desire to see the
marvel of the stackyard and his desire to show as much
manliness as his mother evidently expected of him, there
was a noise on the doorstep and Hepsie came smilingly in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed you all on th&#8217; pony,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I fixed
it up with th&#8217; boys yesterday t&#8217; take a cold dinner to-day
an&#8217; let me come an&#8217; help here. We&#8217;re lookin&#8217; out that you
don&#8217;t hurt yourself to-day, Mis Farnshaw,&#8221; she added,
addressing the older woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you can go to the threshing machine too, grandma!&#8221;
Jack cried with delight. &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go right
now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, Jack,&#8221; Elizabeth said. &#8220;Hepsie didn&#8217;t come
to get the dinner alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she did! She likes to,&#8221; Jack replied so confidently
that they all laughed, and Hepsie fell on the child
and hugged him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_558' name='page_558'></a>558</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I did, Jack. Grandma will show me what
to do, and then she and mamma can take you out to see
the machine go round and round like a big coffee mill,
and maybe Jack can ride one of the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Hepsie! Don&#8217;t put that into the child&#8217;s head,&#8221;
Elizabeth interposed hastily. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have him on
one of those horses for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma says I spoil you, Jack. Run along now, and
let me look after this dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the tables were set and the dinner on to cook,
Elizabeth and her mother took the excited child and
started to the barnyard. Mrs. Farnshaw was pulled
along by the impatient grandson, and Elizabeth came at
some distance behind, having stopped to glance in the
chicken house as she went. The marvellous ant-hill called
a stackyard would not permit Jack to wait for his mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw saw them coming. He would gladly
have avoided his wife and daughter, but Jack took things
for granted and always insisted upon dragging his mother
into his grandfather&#8217;s presence and mixing them up in the
conversation. Elizabeth had dropped behind purposely,
knowing her father&#8217;s feelings toward her, and did not hear
Jack say persuasively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandpa, let Jack drive and make the horses go
round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Jack,&#8221; Mrs. Farnshaw said quickly. &#8220;Mamma
said you could not go on the horsepower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw gave his wife a look of disdain and,
stooping, picked the child up. Mrs. Farnshaw gave a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_559' name='page_559'></a>559</span>
little cry. When his own team came around, Mr. Farnshaw
walked in front of it and started toward the platform
on which Albert stood swinging a long whip.</p>
<p>The &#8220;near horse&#8221; of the Farnshaw team was a stolid
and reliable mare, mother of many colts. She was so
placed because it had been decided to put a young stallion
of uncertain temper beside her.</p>
<p>The restive, irritable beast sustained his reputation by
nipping angrily at Mr. Farnshaw as he dodged under the
straps with which the horses were tied to the reach ahead.
To have passed in front of this team unencumbered and
alone when the power was in motion would have been
foolhardy; but with Jack in his arms it was an act of mock-heroics
typical of the whole bull-headed character of
Josiah Farnshaw. He stumbled slightly in springing out
of the horse&#8217;s way, and with Jack, who was a load, in his
arms, was barely able to keep his feet.</p>
<p>A shout went up from every man who saw the occurrence,
and Albert shut off the power in the endeavour to
stop the machine.</p>
<p>Mr. Farnshaw sprang toward the inner corner of the
triangular space occupied by the team, and as the machine
slowly came to a full stop set Jack on the boards at
Albert&#8217;s feet and turned toward the horses. The stallion
threw a challenge at the man who had escaped its teeth,
reared angrily, shook its black mane, and, with teeth
exposed and ears laid back, prepared for another lunge.
Not only Mrs. Farnshaw but every man on the ground
called to Josiah Farnshaw to get out of the way of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_560' name='page_560'></a>560</span>
infuriated beast. Instead of heeding the frantic warnings,
Mr. Farnshaw, determined to let his onlooking
neighbours see that he was not afraid, sprang forward and
struck the squealing animal a stinging blow on the nose
with his fist. Taken by surprise, the horse set back so
suddenly that he broke the straps with which he and his
mate were fastened to the reach, falling against the mare,
who was thoroughly frightened by her master&#8217;s menacing
blow. The team behind them reared and snorted as the
stallion sprang to its feet again.</p>
<p>Then a strange and terrible thing happened. The
horse stopped and made ready for the plunge he had in
mind. There were warning cries from every man in the
stackyard, but there was no chance to escape. With a
scream which struck terror to the hearts of the onlookers
the brute sprang upon the man and sunk its teeth through
flesh and bone alike as it grabbed the arm which was
aiming a puny blow, and shook him as if he were a rag,
flinging him against the ground under its feet, and shaking
him as a dog shakes a rat it has captured. The men
could not rush in, because the other horse was on the outside
of the team and was kicking and struggling to free
itself from the shrieking stallion. Every team attached
to the machine was tearing at its moorings, and horrified
as the men were they were obliged to attempt to control
the other horses. The team immediately in front of the
stallion broke away altogether, carrying away with it the
reach to which it was fastened. Seeing his opportunity,
Joe Farnshaw rushed into the space left open by the disappearance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_561' name='page_561'></a>561</span>
of the other team, and with a well-directed
blow from an iron bar he had snatched up, he staggered
the horse so that it dropped the nerveless thing it had been
shaking, and stood stunned and trembling, sight, sound,
and all other matters of sense gone. The body was
snatched away from in front of the tottering horse in time
to save it from the heavy weight of the falling animal,
which began to tremble, and then, losing control of its
legs altogether, fell heavily toward the platform, dragging
its mate to her knees as it went.</p>
<p>Elizabeth quieted her shrieking mother as best she could
while she hugged her rescued child to her bosom, and the
sons of Josiah Farnshaw helped the men to lay the broken
body of their father upon an improvised stretcher to be
removed to the house. Kind hands performed the little
duties necessary on such occasions, and then the horrified
men stayed on, gathered in little groups about the dead
stallion in the stackyard.</p>
<p>When all was done and the family were reduced to that
terrorizing state of idleness which comes to those who
stand about their dead, Elizabeth took Jack and wandered
out of the house to where she could see Joe standing near
the well. Together they glanced across to the men standing
around the torn and dismantled horsepower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa was like that horse, Joe,&#8221; Elizabeth said with a
sudden gleam of insight. &#8220;They were both ruled by
unbridled passions. Everything they did they mixed up
with hate. You couldn&#8217;t touch either of them without
having them lay back their ears.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;TILL DEATH DO YOU PART&#8221; CONSIDERED</h3>
</div>

<p>The day after Josiah Farnshaw was buried, Elizabeth
sat down to answer John&#8217;s letter. It was
not easy to do, and she sat for a long time with her
chin in her hand before she began to write. The death of
her father related to the things of which she must speak.
She began by telling him the circumstances of her father&#8217;s
death and showed him that the tragedy had been the
result of pride and the habit of domination, of an unwillingness
to listen to advice, or to discuss necessary matters.
Her brothers had urged that the stallion be left in
the barn and that another horse be substituted, since by
its outcries and prancings it would keep the strange
horses nervous and irritable, but Mr. Farnshaw, having
said in the beginning that the animal should be used, would
not listen to anything that the family wished him to do in
the matter. Mrs. Farnshaw had objected to Jack being
placed upon the horsepower, but once having started to
place him there, her husband would listen to no caution.
Last but not least of those refusals to advise with those
who knew as well as he what should be done had been the
one of not heeding the cries of the men who had warned
him not to approach the vicious brute. To dominate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_563' name='page_563'></a>563</span>
had been the keynote of her father&#8217;s character; his death
had been a fitting symbol of his overweening desire to
pursue that phantom.</p>
<p>After enlarging upon the causes of the tragedy, she
took up the matter of the refusal to listen to necessary
explanations which had had so much to do with her
separation from her husband.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Hugh Noland&#8217;s life was sacrificed because he could not go to you and talk to you of
necessary things, and I am determined that if you and I ever come together
again that neither of us shall be afraid to talk out anything in this whole world that is
of interest to us both. Hugh and I would have been so glad to go to you and ask you
to let him be taken away, or to have asked you to help us to higher living till he was
well enough to go. I need hardly tell you that we both recognized that it was wronging
you for him to stay on in the house after we discovered that we loved each other. Hugh
planned to go, and then came the accident, and we were helpless. At last, in order not
to defeat me when he saw that I was trying to overcome the fault in myself, he thought
it necessary to die so that I should be free. You know, John dear, I should never try
to live with you again unless I could tell you <i>anything</i> and know that you&#8217;d listen and
be fair, even to my love for another man. There you have me as I am. If you don&#8217;t
want me, don&#8217;t take me; but at least you are not deceived about the kind of woman you
are going to live with this time.</p>
</div>
<p>Then Elizabeth pointed out to him how he had refused to read Hugh&#8217;s innocent letter, and then went on to consider
affairs between herself and John.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>You will probably remember also that when we were talking over the coming of our
second child five years ago you said that I was foolish to be disturbed about it&mdash;that
if I had not had the wherewithal to feed and clothe it I might have had good cause for
complaint, but otherwise not. That is another matter we must settle before we reopen
life together. Mere food and clothes are but a part of a child&#8217;s natural and proper
rights of inheritance. My future children&mdash;and I hope I shall have more than the
one I have now&mdash;must be prepared for earnestly and rightly. We are better prepared
to have children now than when we were younger, but if we wish the best from our
children, we must give the best to their beginnings as well as to their upbringings, and
you and I would, I am sure, come much closer to each other and begin to understand
each other much better after adopting such a policy. When we were married our
love would not permit us to exact conditions, but I have learned to love you and myself
enough to wish to consider all the conditions of which I have been speaking before we
begin to live together again.</p>
<p>Years ago I was glibly willing to advise my mother to get a divorce&mdash;for her I am not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_564' name='page_564'></a>564</span>
sure yet but that it was the only way to freedom&mdash;but I have lived and learned, and
you see that for myself I have not wanted it. I have come to understand that you and
I are bound together&mdash;not by the fact of Jack&#8217;s presence, I mean not by the mere
knowledge that we have him, but by some other law of which he is but the outward
evidence. No magistrate could separate us. I belong to you and you belong to me by
some primal law of life, not because some minister said over us, &#8220;Till death do you
part,&#8221; but because <i>we have permitted ourselves to become one flesh</i>. Having set up these
relations, let us struggle with the conditions they entail.</p>
<p>There must be freedom in our home if it is to be reorganized. I want you to be just
as free as I am. I told you before you left that you should run the farm; I still prefer
it. I don&#8217;t care what you do on it, so long as you do not mortgage it. I think I have
a right to keep a certain part of it free from debt if I choose to do so, so as to be sure of a
home in my old age, since I have to suffer if we lose it; otherwise you are free to do
as you wish with any part of it.</p>
<p>I think I have a better sort of love to offer you than I had before, just because it
includes a knowledge of our weaknesses. I have had to tell you all this in order that we
begin square, but I liked your letter, and I believe we can come to an understanding.
My love for Hugh Noland is but a memory, but when your letter came I found that
my love for you was a living thing, that I wanted you very much, and even as I write
you these words I want you.</p>
</div>
<p>When her writing was finished Elizabeth went to the barn
to saddle the horses, thinking that she would take Jack
with her and ride into town to mail both letters in the cool
of the evening. She saddled Jack&#8217;s pony and started
around the corner of the barn to tie it in the lane,
when she saw, turning into that lane, John Hunter,
with a valise in his hand. He had come in on the noon
train and had caught a ride out home with a stranger
passing that way. John saw her and waved his hand,
calling to her. To Elizabeth he was still fair to look
upon. She walked toward him holding out the letters
she had written.</p>
